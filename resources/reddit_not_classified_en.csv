3,"Interesting that all you see in the news, including Washington post and nytimes, is headlines about tech layoffs. Which is a thing but the lazer focus on negative headlines gives the impression that everything is going to shit.",-1,-1
4,"I remember my parents would clap back with “more people are working than ever before!” when I critisized Trump. 

Wonder if they’re as excited about Biden’s job numbers that blow Trump’s out of the water",-1,-1
5,"I likely have the job market Biden helped create to thank for my recent change in jobs.  8 months ago I was working at the same company I've been working for for 15 years getting underpaid for a job that kept having additional jobs rolled into it.  By the time I left, I was doing about 3 1/2 jobs.  They just kept eliminating positions and adding those responsibilities to my job with no additional pay.  

Now I'm working a job that pays 20k more, fully remote, amazing benefits, and a workload that feels like a never ending vacation to me in comparison.  Oh, and I just got promoted, got a raise, and a pretty nice bonus.  They're working hard to keep me happy because if I leave, they will now have a very hard time replacing me. 

That never would have happened if the job market hadn't shifted to the point that the employees actually have some power for a change.",-1,-1

15,"Conservative media has been screeching for the last couple weeks about how this report was going to prove how Democrats are incompetent, Biden sucks, whatever else.

30,"Lowest unemployment in decades and yet the blowhard co-founder of Home Depot is whina about people not wanting to work. I think it a case of not want to work for a shitbag operation that over expects and under compensates.

Low unemployment, higher pay, are meaningless if everything else goes through the roof. We need to figure out how to keep housing prices from spiking like they have been. At the same time I feel like we're going to have a ton of investors and home buyers that bought over the past few years end up underwater when things settle down. That home they bought for 40k over the already high asking price is going to end up worth $100k less if we're not careful.",-1,-1

54,"Now I just want to remind everyone, unemployment isn't a binary ""person A has or doesn't have a job"", but rather one person working 4 jobs to stay afloat and 3 homeless, unemployed people is also a 100% employment rate. 

When I hear how the majority in North America are living paycheck to paycheck, and I see homeless camps in every single city, I know what those numbers actually say. 

Employment stats should only show the percent of the population with at least one job, and a separate stat showing the average number of jobs people hold.  THAT would tell the story a lot more accurately than these feel-good reports.",-1,-1

73,Everyone’s working but everyone’s broke!,-1,-1
74,This all sounds great on the surface but I'd love to know how many of those people are working 2 or 3 jobs just to make ends meet. The article doesn't seem to mention that. I feel like knowing that number would paint a more complete picture.,-1,-1

Trump constantly bragged about the unemployment rate pre-COVID and was lauded for it.",-1,-1

91,I read that wrong at first.,-1,-1
92,Almost as if the American workforce is smaller.... Perhaps due to million surplus deaths over 3 years... Plus illnesses... Must be shark attacks.,-1,-1
93,Is there a report on how many of those jobs provide a living wage?,-1,-1

105,Well that's good news since my company just told me they are laying off 8%.  merr,-1,-1
106,I'm seeing IT laid off all over the place. Also if you've exhausted all your unemployment benefits you don't show up in these numbers. Then there's COVID that hit the country hard. A lot of people that lost their jobs are now joining workforce again.,-1,-1

138,"I wish when they did these reports, that they would only report on jobs that meet the livable wage threshold for each state. The numbers would be a lot lower if they did.",-1,-1
139,"So inflation is going down… product cost is starting to go down, home prices are falling (in some areas), lease prices are just starting to pull back a bit, gas prices are down, but job numbers are going up… so we keep raising interest rates? So if we need more production for prices to go down, then more jobs is a good thing? Yet the fed says that more jobs (more money to spend) is a bad thing. I just can’t wrap my head around it. Can someone ELI5?",-1,-1
140,And those unfuckable M & M's,-1,-1

143,"I keep telling people look at what each side is angry about to decide where you fall.

151,"It was on LinkedIn, so take it with a huge grain of salt, but someone posted a graph showing layoffs this past year versus the head count growth at those same companies the two years prior (all tech companies btw). The layoffs are just a tiny fraction of how many jobs were actually created the last few years. They’re more of a “correction” by these companies that saw massive growth during/post COVID than a sign the economy is tanking.",-1,-1
152,"Thats because the 1% is trying hard to will a recession into reality so that workers dont get the leverage that comes with a tight labor market and a churning economy.

Make no mistake, the 24 hour coverage of the coming recession is propaganda trying to spook the economy into a recession. The people who decide what corporate mainstream media covers do NOT want a healthy economy right now since some serious labor gains have happened and might continue to happen.",-1,-1

154,"Even the tech layoffs are a minor fraction of the overall growth the industry has had since COVID.  Amazon has gone from 800K to 1.6M employees. Laying off 20K doesn't mean anything. Microsoft added like 60K jobs. Letting go of 15K still keeps them bigger than they were before.

There is a lot of media attention on tech layoffs but at the end of the day any of those people can go find new jobs easily as long as they are actually skilled.",-1,-1

157,"Maybe

Unemployment is not the same as Underemployment (not measured), wherein People are working but not able to support themselves on their income.

Underemployment is just as important in the determination of the state of the economy but is seldom promoted, because the switch to ""Gig Economies"" has greatly increased this number.

159,"The 516k is the establishment survey.  Which should be noted has a ton of fuckery going with it.  It should be a smoothed graph, so when things like this crop up, you need to ask why.  The preceding four months all show a consistent downtrend, combine that with December (q4) sales are down across the board, ISM manufacturing data has fallen off a cliff (stuff like new orders) and the yield curve is more inverted than it has ever been.

This is especially true as the secondary part of the data set (which MSM, government aren't talking about) is the household survey, which shows only 84k new jobs.

That is a huge disparity when normally they are fairly close together.

That said, it's a bit of a psychological play by the government.  If people think the economy is going to shit, they won't spend as much, if they think it's doing great, they will spend more.

There of course is only one problem with that, people don't have more money to spend.  Every time the Fed raises rates, CC minimum payments go up, car loan payments go up, mortgages go up, the amount of refis goes down (which could be used as a source of liquidity by consumers). and inflation hasn't come down so much that it's freeing up enough to match.

The government isn't going to tell you things are falling off a cliff until well after you're mid air.",-1,-1

They don't see the connections. They don't see how the their situation was the beginning of the time where most families need both parents working and how that leads to more people working than ever before. They see the more people working than ever before as a positive, not the slow drain on the middle and lower classes to prop up the billionaires.",-1,-1
163,"I'm not excited about either, because the pay still largely sucks.

It's a little better now because labor has flexed its muscle slightly, but the fed is doing everything it can to shit on labor to ""cool inflation"" when they should be taxing corporate windfall profits instead.

People need to keep organizing, keep forming/joining unions, keep leaving shit jobs, and keep demanding work from home if they want it and it works better for them/their work can be done from home.

But unemployment numbers are a smokescreen. They often ignore those who just stopped asking for unemployment, and ignore all the jobs that are poverty wage dogshit.

Biden ain't Trump so I'm not trying to do some both sides bs. I'm just saying our economy is not doing as well as they want to pretend it is. The working class is still getting F'd.

Biden gets some mild credit for being sort of pro union when it's easy, but loses a lot for stopping strikes once it becomes hard, too.",-1,-1
164,"Obama had the longest stretch of high job growth of any President in modern history, and when I mentioned this to Republicans at the time, they simply claimed it wasn’t true.

Same with how they refuse to admit that in the 3 years before COVID, GDP actually grew less than Obama’s final years in office.

The truth is that Trump’s pre-COVID economic numbers were pretty meh and continued the economic course he inherited. The claim that Republicans are somehow better for the economy is a flat out lie.",-1,-1

Left a job where I was super underpaid, super overworked, for a fully remote job that pays double my old salary, tons of appreciation from my team and leadership, and the workload feels like a cakewalk.

They have all but admitted in the past their goal was to create ""uncertainty"" so that workers could not feel safe to quit and look for better opportunities. Recent comments around rate hikes have shown they want to ""cool the economy"" by creating more uncertainty.

So many restaurants/bars/retail etc are closing brick and mortar or doing drive thru/delivery only.   If everyone is working, why is there such a staffing issue?   And it’s not just wages.  In my podunk ass town in the Deep South McDonald’s is paying $15/hr, more than the factories and the chicken processors but they’re always skeleton crew and the lobby is always closed.   Same with Starbucks.  A bunch of local favorite restaurants where people make bank can only seat half capacity because of being short staffed (and I say this about the wages as someone who waited tables and bartended all through college and law school).  A bunch of these restaurants have waiters making over $20/hr but cannot get anyone to even apply.

4. Immigration was cut to nearly zero for a few years.

Which as you can guess ended predictably.

>The Statute of Labourers (and its counterpart, the Ordinance of Labourers) was, of course, **very unpopular with the peasants, who wanted higher wages and better living standards, and was a contributing factor to subsequent peasant revolts**, most notably the English peasants' revolt of 1381. Similar processes happened throughout Europe – wage caps following a labour shortage after the Black Death resulting in popular revolts.

People have had smaller families for decades.

Having two homes is expensive, which is why most people don’t do it. Making it harder to be in congress if you don’t come in with two house money seems like inequitable policy.

This could take the form of congressional housing rather than higher pay, but DC is really heavily limited by zoning laws and I’m not sure burdening more of its land with fixed-use buildings is a great idea.

Don't let them get away with saying Disney had special privileges; nearly every retirement development in Florida has those exact same privileges.

Also, this is going to stick Florida with a $2B municipal bond Disney took out to build roads. As well as making central Florida taxpayers responsible for the upkeep of all the infrastructure Disney handled, including transition costs and hiring new personnel.

Lawmakers will also address hurricane recovery and two local water control districts.

Tons of convention business goes down there because of how much the Orlando area can support, as a result of the mouse. Sure, there are beaches and whatever, but Disney put this state over the top. 

I would like to think that Disney would call his bluff and start work to relocate the park as a result.

Disney has some very specific requirements for any new park, the three big ones are: lots of inexpensive land (right now WDW is 25,000 acres), reasonable access (less than an hour’s drive, preferably 30 minutes) from a major airport, and weather potentially warm enough year-round to keep the parks open. 


The third one may be the stickiest: in the US, that means well below the Mason-Dixon Line, and probably farther south than that (Disney was planning on building a history-themed park near Manassas until locals got it shut down), which in reality that means TX, OK, AR, LS, MS, AL, FL, GA, SC, *maybe* TN, *maybe* MO. Those are all states who, while they could use the tourist revenue, are on the same extreme political end as FL’s current administration, and I can’t see Disney risking that much of any potential investment without a completely ironclad agreement with that state’s legislature; they thought they had that with Reedy Creek, and even that has been called into question.

1360,"That's precisely the crux of the entire thing. Right now Disney -does- pay.  They cover the costs of all of that in exchange for what is basically a level of autonomy and executive decisioning over those areas covered by the special district. If Desantis gets rid of it, then all of that work and personnel and everything suddenly becomes the taxpayer's problem, because now those are public roads maintained by some other district, whether it's the cities of Orlando, Kissimmee, Lake Buena Vista, Winter Garden, Celebration, etc, or Orange county, Osceola county, or some other municipality. They all get to bear the brunt of billions of dollars in costs that they haven't had to deal with before. And the idea that Floridians who live there wouldn't just up and bail when their taxes go up an extra 2 grand a year is a pipe dream. People will flee, all the touristy stuff including Disney will suffer from less available people to staff the parks and restaurants and hotels and other attractions, and the area will begin to suffer, wither, and die. And then the whole state will start to suffer because it's a big percentage of the entire state's revenue each year.",-1,-1

They don’t need anyone to report to clergy because that would require them to share power.

They don’t need to install religious leaders into positions of authority because none of their laws or regulations are explicitly bible based, that way they don’t overtly violate the first amendment thus making it harder to challenge or overturn them in court. It’s also why they didn’t name a government body that would be enforcing Texas’s abortion tattling law, it’s much harder to challenge it in court and it gives the portion of the population power to help the state keep control over all citizens. 

The comparison to the Taliban fails to realize just how sophisticated things are here. The Taliban actually believe in what they’re doing, that’s not true of the Republicans in power here or the religious lobbyists who are writing the laws that a plethora of states will introduce and pass en mass.

1508,"How I fucking wish ""Kids in cages"" never became the misleading rallying cry against Trump when ***kidnapped children*** was the more accurate description of what the administration was doing that needed to be stopped immediately.

How many times have you seen some galaxy brain talk about how ""Oh nobody says 'kids in cages' anymore now that it's ok Biden is doing it!"" Yeah it was a stupid and inaccurate criticism to begin with, because any kind of policy of detaining people caught trying to cross the border illegally will fit the ""kids in cages"" meme. 

The entire reason people got mad at Trump beyond the border wall nonsense was because he specifically ordered a family separation policy that was designed to function as a cruel deterrent to immigration. The Obama administration was forced to adopt a family separation policy because courts ruled that minors could not be detained with adults when detained by ICE, but the Trump administration embraced this policy and added on kidnapping and forced separation *across the country* which resembled human trafficking more than any kind of immigration policy.

And yeah, Biden is reuniting people while still maintaining a policy of not letting anyone cross the border anywhere at any time for any reason. We can talk about the ethics of detaining people caught trying to cross a national border illegally, and we should.

That's obviously an extreme example, but it's not dissimilar to Trump purposefully breaking up families and not even trying to put them back together.

It stands for The Native American Languages Act of 1990, and it made Native American languages federally legal. (This was important because there were many places in America where the use of Indian Languages remained *illegal.*) It also gave tribes the right to use their languages on official documents and within their own schools. Prior to NALA they were required to use English.  NALA also meant an end to the forced adoption of the English language for Indian children. **1990**. Not 1890. Not even 1969. 1990. That was when Congress officially guaranteed the right of Native Americans to use our languages.


What does this have to do with the Tuskegee Experiments and the illegal separation of immigrant children? I'm sure you've heard of the cruelty and brutality of the Native American boarding schools,  but you may be under the assumption, like most people, that they were ended in the 19th century.  But sadly that's not the case. They continued through the 60's, the 70's, and even the 80's. Sure,  there were token reforms every so often,  less kids died and conditions improved, but they continued. In 1973 60,000 American Indian kids were in boarding schools. 60,000 kids forcibly separated from their families,  beaten, starved,  treated badly.  Millions over the years. It was horrible. Yet, when you needed to think of a national tragedy to compare to the separation of immigrant children from their parents,  you reached for the Tuskegee Experiments.


This isn't some slight against you,  or some asshole attempt to call you out, or paint you as a racist or anything terrible. Instead,  it's a reality check. That's the truth of America's cruelty. We have forgotten so much evil. It's hard to keep the bad in our memories when those with power want us to forget. When the media wants our attention on other things.

The strategy is currently embodied in state laws that include provisions denying education, transportation, and even basic services like water and housing to anyone who cannot prove legal immigration status.

Again OBAMA didn’t DO it it was the Government as a whole body. I bring Obama into it to show that just Bc it’s blue doesn’t mean it’s GOOD. It’s a government system with minimal oversight, but in the last 4 year the blame is ONLY on one guy and NOT everything",-1,-1

2054,""".... like all such treaties ratified by the Senate, is part of the binding law of the United States.""

This is NOT always true as a general statement.  The Constitution is clear that it can be amended only after ratification by states, etc.  Even if ratified by the Senate, courts will not enforce an unconstitutional treaty.  

I see a few potential legal hurdles supports will need to address.  

For clarity, this article talks only about a *non-voting* delegate.  That may be Constitutional, idk.  

Some comments are confusing with a regular, voting Congressman.  Under today's laws, a fully voting member for the Cherokee would conflict with the Constitution's one-person, one-vote principle *unless* the Cherokee also agreed to stop voting for the state's other congressional candidates.

When the treat was signed, Cherokee had zero say in US legislation since they generally were not considered citizens.  Decades after the treaty was signed, the US passed the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 allowing Native Americans the vote in federal elections, including for Congress.  In reviewing the treatise's Article 7 current enforceability, a court may review whether the purpose (of giving Cherokee representation in Congress) *already* has been fulfilled since, like you and me, they can vote for Congressmen.  

Another potential legal hurdle is whether and which Cherokee legally authorized the treaty.  It was hugely unpopular amongst regular Cherokee at the time, primarily for cessation of land in exchange for payment of $5,000,000, assumption of debts, and other incentives.   Many Cherokee immediately claimed that their purported representatives were not authorized to bind them on their behalf.  I'm sure historians can shed more light on the factual details than I can.",-1,-1

I'm reading the treaty and I don't see where it requires them to become a state. to the contrary, it specifically mentions that they have removed themselves to an area that is outside of the territory of the states, so I think it really evidences that they don't have to be a state.  that's assuming I'm looking at an accurate copy and also didn't miss a provision in here.

however ... I'm a little afraid that this treaty language is precatory and not entirely binding.   Please note I'm totally in favor of it anyway! but gee whiz it doesn't seem to be worded well.

here's what I find in the treaty itself (prepare yourself for really awful white supremacy/colonialism): ""[Margin descriptor: “Congress may allow a delegate from the Cherokee nation.”]   “ARTICLE 7. The Cherokee nation having already made great progress in civilization and deeming it important that every proper and laudable inducement should be offered to their people to improve their condition as well as to guard and secure in the most effectual manner the rights guarantied to them in this treaty, and with a view to illustrate the liberal and enlarged policy of the Government of the United States toward the Indians in their removal beyond the territorial limits of the States, it is stipulated that they shall be entitled to a delegate in the House of Representatives of the United States whenever Congress shall make provision for the same.”

- most federally recognized tribes formally allow and currently have many members with significant non- indigenous genes. 

- millions of ""white"" and ""black"" Americans have indigenous genes from ancestors 150+/- years ago.

- As you note, many millions of Americans came to the US after the western frontier had closed.  Irish, Polish and Czech immigrants in the early 20th century had nothing to do with Andrew Jackson's ""Indian"" policy.

- Millions of more American came here more recently as refugees.   Should we blame the white Ukrainian family moving to New Mexico for taking stolen land? Should we blame their grandchildren?

- Millions of 17th and 18th century Americans came here to escape political oppression, torture and war.  They were refugees too.  Puritans and Huguenots were tortured in Europe.  Many Virginia planters were supporters of Charles I who had to flee after his execution.  Should we blame their grandchildren? 

- There were white Americans who worked hard in the 18th and 19th century for better treatment of indigenous groups.  The treaty discussed in this article passed the Senate by ONE VOTE. Hugely controversial. How is blaming everyone then different from 100 years from now blaming some Antifa for Trump's policies.  

- finally, no one is genetically pure.  Most of us have a mix of good and bad and forgotten ancestors.   You do not have DNA from all of them.   Go back 10 generations.  That's about 1000 people.  You likely have DNA from only about 100 of them since DNA is not evenly divided in each generation.   It generally travels in clumps (chromosomes).

2236,"The upper house of the UK, the House of Lords, like the Crown, has had it powers transfer to the lower house, the House of Commons, over many years. Today the House of Lords is more of an advisory body and reviews and debates proposed legislation coming from lower house. What bills they can actually block is very limited. Its members are appointed and mostly, maybe all?, are nobility.

Ironically, Senators being elected is a recent development (1913). They were originally appointed by state legislatures which makes sense when you think about original purpose of the Senate to act as an opposing body to lower house. The difference is the power of the House of Lords has devolved over time while arguably the Senate has accumulated more power (judicial appointments becoming more and more partisan) and by design acts as a check against that ""commoner mob"" (i.e. the popularly elected House of Representatives).

What I'm arguing for is to reduce the power of the Senate. It's design is absolutely obsolete, and it is by its design anti-democratic. They could still be popularly elected, but let's be honest, they're acting in the interest of the state as intended not in the interests of a state's or the country's people. This is what's so very frustrating about the 60-vote filibuster, a very recent development (1975). A body that's intended to slow and check the will of the people is made even less democratic by the 60-vote filibuster.

In addition to uncapping the lower house to provide better representation, the federal government would become much more representative. For one, gerrymandering gets harder, house elections become much more local, special interests will have a much harder time trying to corral \~3000+ representatives, and a two-party system will also likely be much harder to enforce.

How a tribe establishes its membership criteria is up to the tribe, in the eyes of the United States government a person's race is irrelevant to their tribal membership.

Questions of tribal rights and autonomy should be dealt with as a matter of engaging with dependent, autonomous nations, not as a matter of racial relations within the United States' legal framework.

It gets extra confusing/stupid because Indigenous/Native American is an acknowledged race in the United States, and legal questions involving violations of civil rights do apply when the race of a person affects their treatment by the United States government.

Yeah but also they aren't working it out themselves so what you think isn't aligning with the reality of the situation. 

The reality of the situation is that this whole situation exists because indigenous people were denied agency by colonizers. The situation can only be rectified by restoring that agency. What happens after that is anybody's business. But you can't tell me that giving more systemic power to oppressed indigenous peoples would ever be a bad thing. I just don't believe it.

Give seats to all three. Heck, give three seats to every indigenous tribe in the US. Let them take every seat of congress.

This is what will happen with this idiotic situation too. But when something is being done at the state level, and the state won't just back down with threats of lawsuits, then it actually goes to the Courts. That is always going to be a very slow process though. 

Usually political pressure corrects these errors faster, but DeSantis won overwhelmingly even though it was clear he'd keep doing stuff like this.

Now, should the venue be punished? Of course not. This is the state retaliating because parent's apparently aren't responsible enough to read the multiple warnings about the show not being suitable for young children.

And I don’t think the new one that they organize are planning to rely on elections to get and maintain power. But hopefully I’m just a doomer.,-1,-1
2659,"I agree with this. As much as I'm often locked in an existential nightmare when I read the news, they are actually not winning a hell of a lot. The more extreme they become, the more they are killing their party because there is no way out except more fuckery. They have no answers, only more condemnation. No real ideas except being against stuff. This is the barest comfort I have. Because eventually they will lose. But what happens on the way there?",-1,-1
2660,"Yes, these are the bellowing death throes we’re witnessing. We should not become complacent by any means, but we should take a moment to optimistically revel in the absurdity, as it is one of the last steps to demise.",-1,-1

2670,I really wish people would stop foisting hateful jackasses back onto us. You can be a bigot without being a self-loathing closet case. It feels... kinda victim-blamey? Those shitheads are not our responsibility.,-1,-1
2671,"I fucking hate the 'this homophobic politician is just gay! No there is no evidence to prove my claim but they're always gay soooo' shtick.

2674,Really?! Does anyone even acknowledge how radically things seem to have changed? I just can’t imagine still living like life is still the same at all. Hearing that they’re openly mocking it and are happy about it tho is fcking chilling. And it makes me less empathetic for any self-inflicted fallout they bring upon themselves. How tf are people so hyperfocused now only on constant rage?,-1,-1
2675,"there's no evidence of that. It's not our responsibility even if he is, but if it *happened* to come out that he is, suddenly it's the fault of the gay community because he's one of ours. Very much a ""well just stop hitting yourself"" thing.

2677,"Yeah, but that's just spreading Tucker Carlson's hateful rhetoric. Also, are you sure it is the same show? Is it the show that's advertised for all ages or is it a separate one that isn't and the two are being compounded together to create a false narrative?

2679,Not to mention they’ve managed to piss off two whole generations to absurd degrees. Between Gen Z and Millennials the only Republican Presidents most will have  any memory of are Trump and Bush. Not to mention the shit show that’s other notable senators and representatives. Why would voters 40 and younger have any faith in republicans? The overwhelming majority of two generations are a lost cause for Republicans.,-1,-1
2680,"The ideology certainly won’t go away, but as the party diminishes in power and/or dies they don’t have the branding that comes with the Republican Party, and the remaining generations won’t have the same fondness of the party. The Republicans are experiencing brain drain right now, soon they will atrophy and die off as a party. That’s not to say everything will be fine, we as a country are still in immense danger. They don’t need to go all the way to full Nazi Germany to be a major threat, but I do think we’ll avoid the worst possible outcome.",-1,-1
2681,"Also take a look at the quality of their candidates, this is the best they have to offer. As scary and upsetting as this all is, they are experiencing brain drain now. The party is dying off and what’s left are grifters, opportunists, and the true believers of their propaganda. Things can definitely get worse and they probably will, but long term I think they’ve already lost. Now we just gotta hope they don’t cause too much damage before the party dies off. My theory is that as the GOP is taken over by the crazies, the country as a whole will begin to look more like California. Moderate conservatives will become neoliberal/corporate democrats. And once the GOP is irrelevant the Democratic Party will split between the Neolibs being the new Conservative Party and a Progressive party being the new left wing party.",-1,-1

Their rhetoric has gotten more intense in 2018, 2020, and 2022 and all three years were historic losses for them. I’d say they’re in a difficult place in that they need the rhetoric to increase in intensity to keep their base but it’s only pushing more and more voters away. They’re experiencing brain drain and their pockets of control will eventually grow smaller over the next decade or two.",-1,-1

2689,"💯 agree with you. DeSantis isn’t limiting himself to solely being preoccupied with obsessing over the LGBTQ community. Hes a fascist. Hes going after: women, PoC, public schools, private corporations, immigrants, colleges, girls sports, vaccines, and any other opportunities he can find to be cruel and controlling. None of which has anything to do with his own personal sexuality, it’s just textbook fascism. Reducing the threat he poses to hahaha gay! is myopic in addition to feeding into offensive misconceptions and stereotypes that veer into victim blaming.

It's peppered with classic, catty, drag-tastic moments. Though drag has gone mainstream in recent years, its roots are as an adult entertainment art form. This is, in many ways, a traditional drag show. The show's motto is, The holidays have never been this naughty. **This show is frank about sex, will use some profanity and is not suitable for children.**""

So it absolutely isn't advertised as all ages. If kids are in the audience, it is because their parents brought them there. No different than kids being at an R-rated movie.

1) Trump is gonna come out of the gate with 30% of the party firmly behind him, so you've gotta match or exceed that starting in Iowa and keep it up all the way to the RNC to get the nomination.

2) You've gotta gameplan for how you're gonna convince the 30% of the party that's ride-or-die for Trump to vote for you in the general if Trump launches a third-party bid, otherwise you're done before you even really hit the general.

3) You're gonna have to figure out how to do (1) and (2) without pissing off a critical mass of independents you're gonna need to win over in order to beat Biden or whoever else is on the Democratic side.

And that's just the basics. So if you're Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, Mike Pompeo, Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Mike Pence, or whatever other microwaved fish the GOP is rolling out this week for President, you're gonna have to ask yourself how you solve for X up there, otherwise you're wasting a bunch of donor money.

What's worse is that this isn't just a 2024 problem for you. Until this dipshit is serving out the rest of his natural life in a Federal prison or dead, he's gonna run every four years just to fuck over the party, knowing he can endlessly grift off his dumber than rocks base as long as he's running for something.",-1,-1

2816,"You will get your wish. There is absolutely zero chance that Trump will endorse another GOP candidate for president in 2024. In fact, if he is not the GOP candidate for president in 2024 he will run as an independent or his own MAGA cult party and split the vote handing the GOP a guaranteed loss. He doesn't give a single fuck about anyone but himself. I'd bet everything I own on it. The GOP is absolutely fucked.

edit: typo",-1,-1

2818,"Idk, hedging bets I think. Moag likely, he plows forward proving he controls a large % of the GOP base until the federal indictments show up. He then behind the scenes exchanges his withdrawal and desantis endorsement for a blanket pardon, essentially guaranteeing the drsantis win. Then all that's left is to concoct the years long delay tactics to wait out the clock on the state charges.",-1,-1

Which would be basically Guarantee that nobody from the right can win the election.",-1,-1

2858,"I think this is the correct take. There's no way trump, who still hasn't admitted to losing 2020 or the popular vote in 2016 is going to capitulate to desantis. Even if it's in his absolute best interest, he still aint going to do it.",-1,-1
2859,"It's not like he has a chance to win this time though. And before anyone says ""oh that's what 2016 said but look what happened"" Soooo  much shit has gone down since then. He lost in 2020 and then soooo much more shit has gone down that even R. Murdoch has thrown him aside.",-1,-1
2860,"It's a little different this time, though. Trump won the primaries handily. He had the popular support. If the polling is to be believed, DeSantis wins pretty easily over Trump. If that happens, will the party pick Trump over DeSantis?

If Trump will run as a third party candidate, it puts them in a tough spot. If they make Trump the candidate, they're guaranteed to hemorrhage voters from the center. If they make DeSantis the candidate, they have to sell the idea that a vote for Trump is basically a vote for the Democrat and hope they don't lose too many from the far right.",-1,-1
2861,He might get a blanket pardon from such a deal. That won't stop him from immediately committing fresh crimes.,-1,-1
2862,No this cant be allowed to happen. My god that would be the absolute worst case scenario,-1,-1

2864,I don't think he or the folks that orbit around him are smart enough to realize this is an option for him.,-1,-1

2869,"If you ask me, that sounds like losing for poor Harris",-1,-1
2870,"there's a problem with this though. right now the US election (plurality voting) does not allow for this situation. if noone gets 270 electoral college votes, the house decides who wins. so even if the democrat has the closest to 270 votes, the house would just place a republican.   


This would probably cause the start of a new civil war.",-1,-1
2871,"No, and even if he went to prison he could still run, because unless it's specific laws he broke (like treason), there's no law preventing criminals from being president",-1,-1

Small potential to backfire. He has the brand recognition  other independents lack. Chance he could be the protest vote. Vote R without voting R.",-1,-1
2883,Highly likely at this point,-1,-1
2884,This is why the Georgia case is so important. A president can't pardon that conviction.,-1,-1
2885,And why an insurrectionist shouldn't be eligible to run for public office,-1,-1
2886,"they may not be smart enough, but theyre certainly evil enough",-1,-1
2887,There’s no deadline across all states. Really as long as you file the proper paperwork and meet individual state requirements before the ballots are printed that’s all you need. He’d know by June/July if he’s the nominee and would likely have until mid-September to get on most states ballots if he ran 3rd party.,-1,-1
2888,Unfortunately,-1,-1
2889,"Not with how our system works. If Harris gets the most votes in a state (not a majority, just more than Trump or whomever(Desantis), she wins all of the Electors from that state. So take battleground states, like say Pennsylvania. Which can go either way. Let's say that Harris gets 48% of the vote, Trump gets 5% and Desantis gets the remaining 47%. Harris gets all 20 of Pennsylvania's Electors. A unified party will almost always beat a divided party in this contest. Even deep red Utah could be in play with a serious split. Utah votes about 1/3rd Democratic and 2/3rds Republican. If the split in Utah is 50-50 on the Republican side between a Trump/Desantis line up, it is possible for Harris to win deep red Utah.",-1,-1
2890,"They had trouble picking a Speaker. Imagine this same group of clowns trying to pick a President. Perish the thought, eh?

Realistically though, in the event of a Biden/DeSantis/Trump three-way election, it would be very difficult for Biden not to clear 270. Biden would have a puncher's chance at winning a whole bunch of red states with a plurality, like Texas. Biden 45, DeSantis 40, Trump 15, something like that.",-1,-1
2891,That's not a problem though because a unified party would absolutely clean up against a split vote party. Harris would cruise with likely 350+ ECV.,-1,-1
2892,I think Democrats would be able to easily pull 270 if Trump runs as independent. It'd be one of the safest political bets for 2024,-1,-1
2893,"Each state has it's own election and it's winner take all in each state. So I think vote could be 45% Biden and Trump/Republican nominee combined get 55%, but Biden has more votes than either of them so he wins a state like Ohio or Florida even.",-1,-1
2894,"If attempting to stay in power as the U.S. president, after the other guy wins the most electoral votes, isn’t treason, I don’t know what is. And how about praising a dictator who wants to do harm to the people of the United States, while at the same time belittling the U.S. intelligence agencies? Perhaps we need to revise the definition of treason. And isn’t sedition just as bad?",-1,-1
2895,If only we could have seen somehow,-1,-1

2897,"> And the governer of georgia can pardon him no matter what

Nope.",-1,-1
2898,"Georgia is a special case, because the pardon power lies not with the govenor. They have a special office for that and because of the sort of people who live and vote and appoint officials in Georgia, that office is mostly staffed with people who don't like pardoning anyone.",-1,-1
2899,"Feels like something Trump would totally do. Announce his run before everyone else, then sell out to the frontrunner for the pardon.

Then again, could his ego really handle it?",-1,-1

2902,"From the standpoint of the Electoral College, both 2016 and 2020 were decided by extremely slim margins (approximately 77,000 votes and 51,000 votes respectively).

If the Republican candidate loses even 20% of the unified Republican vote in the swing states, the Democratic candidate wins a plurality in those states, and subsequently wins the Electoral College fairly handily.

2907,"Perstate it depends on the state. Some have runoffs, some are decided by the legislature, some are ranked choice, some are proportional. But at the national level, all it would take is a few delegates to shit to trump to cause the house to decide",-1,-1
2908,Either sedition or treason would be enough to disqualify... But he'd have to be convicted... And he won't be.,-1,-1
2909,No. The answer to your question is no.,-1,-1
2910,I think Trump would insist the frontrunner be his VP and then will try to pardon himself when he gets into office.,-1,-1
2911,"His handlers will tell him he won the election by the largest margin in history.  As a result, he gets to run the country from Mar-A-Lago.  There's no need to go to Washington.",-1,-1

3021,"In his interview with Axios around the end of July 2020, Trump defended the Russian government against accusations that it had placed a bounty on U.S. troops in Afghanistan and that it was arming Taliban militants against U.S. troops. There are at least two different ways to defend someone against an accusation. You can try to deny it, or you can try to excuse it. With a denial, you claim that they didn't do it. With an excuse you argue that it would be okay for them to do it.

If you think about it, the first way of defending the Russian government against this accusation could possibly be okay. After all, no matter what the accusation is or who the accused is, the truth matters. A denial was one of the defenses offered by President Trump for this accusation against the Russian government. He called it ""fake news"". If you think he reached this conclusion after sufficiently looking into it and without bias (which some would dispute), then you wouldn't find anything wrong with it.

He didn't stop there, however. When pressed about the issue of the Russian government arming the Taliban he said [the following](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HzB2tAUd64&feature=youtu.be&t=159). ""Well we supplied weapons when they were fighting Russia too."" If you don't think that's an excuse, you're deceiving yourself. It's an excuse. He excused the Russian government against accusations that it is arming the Taliban against U.S. troops.

It's also a bad excuse. Vladimir Putin has said similar things about accusations like this. The problem with it, even when put forward by Putin, is that it was such a long time ago and in a completely different era. Both countries need to let go of these Cold War era grievances to have any chance at peaceful relations. The Soviet Union supported North Korea and North Vietnam against us. Their spies stole the atomic bomb. They tried to arm Fidel Castro with nuclear weapons. Bringing up what we did in Afghanistan 40 years ago is just a low effort nonsensical excuse.

That's the problem with Putin making an excuse like this. With Donald Trump it's so much worse, because that wasn't not his job as President. Even if it were a good excuse, he was the President of *The United States of America*. He shouldn't have been making a list of reasons that it was supposedly okay for other countries to kill our soldiers. His job was to put America first. He didn't do that job.",-1,-1

     Reporter from AP: 

""Thank you. A question for each president. President Trump, you first. Just now President Putin denied having anything to do with the election interference in 2016. Every US intelligence agency has concluded that Russia did.

My first question for you, sir, is who do you believe? My second question is would you now with the whole world watching tell President Putin — would you denounce what happened in 2016 and would you warn him to never do it again?""

     TRUMP: 

""So let me just say that we have two thoughts. You have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server. Why haven’t they taken the server? Why was the FBI told to leave the office of the democratic national committee? I’ve been wondering that. I’ve been asking that for months and months and I’ve been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media. Where is the server? I want to know, where is the server and what is the server saying? With that being said, all I can do is ask the question. My people came to me, Dan Coats came to me and some others and said they think it’s Russia.

I have President Putin. He just said it’s not Russia. I will say this. I don’t see any reason why it would be, but I really do want to see the server [Trump later said he used the wrong word, claiming he meant to say “I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t be Russia”]. But I have confidence in both parties. I really believe that this will probably go on for a while, but I don’t think it can go on without finding out what happened to the server. What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC? Where are those servers? They’re missing. Where are they? What happened to Hillary Clinton’s emails? 33,000 emails gone — just gone. I think in Russia they wouldn’t be gone so easily. I think it’s a disgrace that we can’t get Hillary Clinton’s 33,000 emails. So I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that president Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. And what he did is an incredible offer. He offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators, with respect to the 12 people. I think that’s an incredible offer. Okay thank you.""",-1,-1

Also, I quoted something he said on the record in a major interview with full context of the question that was asked and the recent background circumstances that led to the quote.

Most farmers are Republican, they benefit from the flow of migrants legal or otherwise because CHEAP labor. Drugs? Illegal drugs act to harm communities and to make some people and corporations rich. School tuition was made high to keep young people working for employers with barely growing wages over the years, but the tuition grows very quickly which incentivizes everyone to keep the youth and older former students a slave to the system.  Reagan also cut subsidies to affordable housing and helped to commodify housing more. Nixon killed a lot of banking privacy with the Banking Safety Act, which banks to this day still violate KYC laws yet we can't do the same. Nixon started the major decline in domestic American jobs and helps to move jobs overseas like with China because 1) it made US companies get better profit margins overseas 2) To annoy the USSR by aligning more with Chinese interests.

I've said literally the opposite of this - that it can be fine to deny those allegations - multiple times.

There's also significant distinctions to be made, not least of which was that the US and Russia were trying to have normal relations at the time. If the Russian government wanted to act like the Soviet Union, then, at least short of our overly aggressive militaristic decisions like Vietnam, they should expect that we're going to treat them like the Soviet Union. No more ""reset"" if they were doing that. They weren't doing that, and it would have been potentially okay for Trump to conclude that they weren't doing it, even if he had been wrong.

What wasn't okay was him using generations old grievances to excuse (not just deny but excuse) an accusation of ongoing attacks on American troops. In order to give peace a chance, we have to look past all the antagonistic things the Soviet Union did against us in the Cold War. But Russia also has to look past all of the antagonistic things that we did against the Soviet Union.

When does an anti-Soviet policy by the US stop being an excuse for Russia to possibly pay for American troops to be killed? I'd say at least by the time they changed their whole system of government and stopped being the Soviet Union. When does it become unacceptable for a sitting present to excuse (again not just deny, but excuse) an accusation of an ongoing bounty program on American troops? I'd say immediately, because it wasn't his job to make that argument.",-1,-1

Add traffic and parking tickets to the growing list of legal and political woes facing embattled Rep. George Santos, a Republican from New York, who may owe more than $3,400 in unpaid citations, according to records from New York City and Florida.

A car registered to Santos was cited six times in 2016 and 2017 in Florida. Two tickets for running red lights were paid, but four toll violations racked up late fees and were ultimately sent to collections agencies according to Florida records. Santos, who represents New York's 3rd Congressional District, now owes $1,299.10 for those tolls.

Traffic violations may not be high on the list of worries for the freshman congressman, who is reported to be the subject of both federal and local investigations stemming from questions about the financing of his campaigns. But records show the fines could continue to pile up.

There's a difference in the way people think about & classify voting.  Some people say it's a ""civic duty"".  Others consider it a ""right"", a different sort of object.  I think more Americans  are more familiar with the latter (and not just for voting).  Seat belts, for instance, aren't ""civic duty"" to Americans, despite that being a sensible characterization.  The way they're promoted is heavy-handed:  ""seat belts or death/jail"", similar to driving drunk.  It's a different way of thinking about laws that's just... part of society.  

I don't disagree with what I perceive to be the reasons for compulsory voting.  I'm just not convinced it's the only/best solution, particularly for the US as it exists.

Also in your edit, about only having to go get the paper ballot:  They could just mail everyone a ballot to fill out if they want to and return by mail, and that's the end of it.  That kind of thing would probably be even better in the US, because polling stations are not convenient places.",-1,-1

absolute bullshit and I wish we could fix this on a federal level. Any trial that is open to the public should be able to be recorded and a judge shouldn't be able to stop it.

The only thing I would agree on is that a judge should be able to say 'no publishing of information till the end of the trial', just so the trial isn't affected by the publishing of information about the trial. I don't think publishing should come with jail time though, since it could also be non professionals publishing stuff, making controlling that situation difficult. 

Anyways, I actually think all states should be 1 party. My belief is that all party recording laws are designed to protect politicians when they lie behind closed doors. These laws are not designed to protect the average citizen, in fact the exact opposite.

The only reason we don't see it being used constantly now is because the next few attempts failed horribly. They put forward women to go to the washington post, which failed horribly when they were vetted and the claims easily came up to be false. And they tried with Biden with that employee who made false claims, and instead of every one coming forward and saying 'Yes Biden is a perv' they came forward and said 'He's a bit different, sometimes a little creepy, but he has never came off as having bad intentions'.

4666,Lots of self-proclaimed “alpha males” are wrestling with some cognitive dissonance today.,-1,-1
4667,He's probably lying but I wouldn't be surprised if its true.  Have you ever seen DeSantis in a debate or outside of his hand-picked media reporters?  He's so socially awkward and unstable and has the charisma of a garden slug.,-1,-1

It's a bizarre piece of rhetoric he employs at every given opportunity. I think he thinks it makes him look magnanimous while simultaneously making the other person look weak. I have doubts that anyone has expressed any emotion in front of the man for less than $50,000 any time in the past 20 years.

On the other hand, DeSantis has no heart, can probably cry on command, and will crawl on his hands and knees across broken glass to jerk off a syphilitic stray dog into his own mouth if it means he gets what he wants.",-1,-1

Maybe they're right, maybe I did kill 100 terrorists, because I know terrorists, some of them are my friends, and I say to terrorists, stop with that terror, and you know what? They stop.

4770,"Oh man, this is going to get real entertaining if DeSantis starts swinging back. I hope he does, and doe snot just roll over thinking ""it's fine, I'll run in 2028"".

He must be aware that, if Trump somehow won in 2024, the country would once again go blue after 4 more years of Trump. The last time he won is poisoned the next 3 elections for republicans. So, DeSantis would have a much worse chance of winning if he waited until 2028. Especially after Trump inevitably attempts to change the rules to allow him to run for a 3rd term.

The Conservative subreddit was pretty much ready to ditch Trump after the midterms. They've cooled a bit on that now, and are not paying much attention to these little jabs.

As to DeSantis, his milquetoast, former-Republican opponent has run and lost in 2 of the last 3 gubernatorial elections. Nobody wanted Crist other than his subset of Democratic primary voters. There was 0 excitement around that campaign and very little money. Added to that is the fact that DeSantis's COVID policy made Florida a hot spot for MAGA migration in the 2 years immediately preceeding the election. None of those factors is going to apply in a national election.

He could win an electoral college victory while losing the popular vote like W and Trump before him, but expecting a landslide is an exercise in self-delusion. Personally, I doubt he wins the nomination as long as Trump stays in the race and remains fixated on trashing him, as happened with Cruz in the example you provided.",-1,-1

Florida is becoming a conservative shit hole just like Texas. When I decided to move here in 2020 (not political reasons, I just hate snow and love the beach) I was under the impression FL was purple. It’s become pretty damn deep red the last few years. 

Every time I tell people I moved here in early ‘21 I get hit with the old “oh you like freedom too huh?” In reference to the fact sooooo many angry Republicans moved here from liberal states (CA, NY, NJ, etc) to get away from “gov suppression” and lock downs. 

They think living under Desantis is freedom. Every other day he’s coming out with some new restrictions against liberal thinking. But as long as he restricts what people like me and my friends can do, that’s okay. Let people run around with ARs and shooting up places and whatever they want, just as long as drag queens never ever ever leave their homes and def not ever look at or talk to a child. 

These people don’t care about government intrusion because Desantis isn’t intruding into their lives.

He's vile, and stupid, and nuts, and yet listening to him is entertaining as hell. I watch a lot of full Trump speeches and interviews because I always laugh my ass off. DeSantis just doesn't have that. I've tried to watch stuff of him too, but he can't keep my attention at all. 

People like DeSantis right now because they're seeing headlines where he does stuff they like. I think he'll start to lose steam when people are actually hearing him speak more.

That's also worth remembering that democracy is literally a popularity contest. So better also means, actually getting more votes so we can continue keeping the GOP from wrecking the country by getting into the White House.",-1,-1
5168,Can you?  Last time you got trump,-1,-1
5169,"Better how? 

Name any democrat that could have gotten more done? 

Biden is effective.",-1,-1
5170,"Ah, someone who's clearly unfamiliar with the Dems bench.  It's bad and worse out there.  Without Biden, it's President DeSantis.",-1,-1
5171,"I'm with you. I don't think Biden really has done that great of a job. Of course if push comes to shove, and it's another Biden V Trump, I will vote for Biden, but say a Larry Hogan Vs Biden, and I could go for Hogan.",-1,-1
5172,You don’t like the bizarre shit he says?  The speeches in which you’ve got zero clue as to wtf he’s rambling on about?  Or the disinformation his administration pushed out on covid?  Can we do better?  😏 when ur at the bottom everything up does seem better,-1,-1
5173,Yeah the NYT is gonna NYT. It's extremely rare for a sitting President to get primaried It's yet another stupid headline in a long line of stupid headlines from them.,-1,-1
5174,Ya got my vote. More than just he’s too old tho.,-1,-1
5175,"Andy Beshear, with Roy Cooper as his running mate

Though I'd prefer Biden",-1,-1
5176,Josh Shapiro?,-1,-1
5177,"Hillary Clinton was a terrible candidate, and she still got 4 million more votes than Donald Trump.  The biggest obstacle to a woman being elected president might be enough pundits running with this false narrative to convince Dem primary voters that it's actually true.  Clinton didn't lose in 2016 because she was a woman, but Warren and Klobuchar might have in 2020 due to this self-fulfilling prophecy.",-1,-1
5178,I think a woman or a gay man could both win.  It's the Democratic establishment that doesn't think a woman or a gay man can win.,-1,-1
5179,"He's actually too old to be a Boomer. He's a silent, the generation that were under 18 when WWII ended.",-1,-1
5180,"I mean, I wouldn't reject a candidate just because they are old just like I wouldn't reject a candidate just because they are young.",-1,-1
5181,"I’ve been waiting a lifetime. 

Honestly, he is too fucking old and that’s not a Alzheimer’s, dementia, ect thing, but a this man could literally die in office thing.

Trump is also too old… and also gross.

Neither should run.",-1,-1
5182,The force multiplier of experience is not to be discounted. Knowing how to implement something is just as important as conceiving what needs to be done.,-1,-1
5183,A lot of voters are old ass people,-1,-1
5184,I like candidates who are experienced,-1,-1
5185,"Speaking personally, I'm for voting for the best person for the job. And that includes a person who will have enough votes to get elected.

Happy to vote for any Democrat who seems genuinely likely to get more votes. I have not seen that Democrat yet. Don't forget Biden beat everyone younger than him in 2020.",-1,-1
5186,Yep. Until the boomers are no longer a major group. Not much longer now.,-1,-1
5187,This is a hit piece. The rough equivalent of damning him with faint praise. No one is forming a cult around Biden. No need to attack him for doing his job.,-1,-1
5188,"Biden certainly will have earned it,  there's literally no one who can get more votes than him right now.",-1,-1
5189,You do know you're commenting on article that says yes they are.  Fact is Biden is doing a good job and right now (still a good 6 months before anyone has to declare they're running) no one is stepping up to challenge him.,-1,-1
5190,"What are you talking about? The article literally says there will be no primary to speak of because there won't be any serious challengers. Besides, Dems really shouldn't hold another expensive primary because that's just shooting themselves in the foot after the astronomically expensive 2020 one. Let the GOP burn their money this time around.",-1,-1
5191,I wish.,-1,-1
5192,"Trump is on the verge of one or more indictments on criminal charges. DeSantis is practically making hate crimes legal in Florida. MTG and Boebert continue to battle to see who can be the dumbest human being alive. All of America knows that McCarthy is practically powerless as Speaker.

Give it time and they’ll hand us the whole damn banquet.",-1,-1
5193,"I highly doubt it, Desantis extremism is only really working in florida, the national stage could be a different story",-1,-1
5194,His biggest economic contribution was passing a tax cut that primarily benefited the rich and will add trillions to the debt.,-1,-1
5195,"Honestly that's great news.   The more zealous they get, the more people will be pushed to the left, and the less of a chance anyone right of center has at the presidency.   If this runs till Trumps death we likely have one fifth of a century to make any advancement we like in left leaning policies, maybe even past that if one of his children continue his insanity!",-1,-1
5196,"Yeah he might be ok, wander how we would play outside of very liberal areas though.",-1,-1
5197,Why bring up Newsome when you could’ve brought up Kamala? Always seems like a red flag when people point out a politician whose only qualification is being a straight white man…,-1,-1

5200,its bad but hes hella old at least trump had some when he is younger and “FIT”,-1,-1
5201,Really thought Buttigieg would be posturing to take up the mantle by now.,-1,-1
5202,He's more than ok. There's no reason to go with someone else when he's as good as he is. His age is a minor concern at most to me.,-1,-1
5203,He also did defeat literally everyone younger than him in the 2020 primaries. As well as beating Bernie Sanders.,-1,-1
5204,"That’s on voters. Left leaning voters didn’t show up to vote in midterms for 20 years and now the party doesn’t have a good bench for state and national elections. That’s why it relies so heavily on candidates that got their start earlier than that. 

Thankfully that’s changing. Look at all of the younger Democrats that won state wide elections in 2022. They’re going to contribution to the bench for future statewide and national elections. If you want younger candidates keep showing up to vote.",-1,-1
5205,He's done great considering the deck he's been given. His infrastructure and climate bills are truly historic. Unfortunately he hasn't had enough support from Congress to do anything about marijuana or healthcare or much of anything else.,-1,-1
5206,"And here again we go with people who believe the President can wave a magic wand and fix things. The President signs bills and enforces federal law, they can't just sign a piece of paper and give more funding to schools or end the drug war. These things have to be fought in the Congress and delivered to his desk. Smh, they really don't teach civics anymore do they? Must be the President's fault.",-1,-1
5207,">Not to discredit some of his accomplishments, but Marijuana is still illegal federally. Healthcare is still a mess. Our schools are still underfunded. We have a national drug crisis going on with meth and fentanyl.

Those are all things that would have to be dealt with legislatively, and Democrats simply don't have the votes. They didn't last Congress, and they don't this Congress, either. That's not Biden's fault, it's voters' faults.

>Sure, I guess I’ll vote for him if I have to in 2024, but literally anyone younger than 65 who is actually interested in fixing the things above that are important to me will have my vote first.

Are they going to improve Democrats' margins in the Senate, flip the House, and give better House margins than we had in the 117th Congress?",-1,-1
5208,"Perhaps, but he’s plainly gotten weaker since then.",-1,-1
5209,Trump was never going to be a stronger candidate than when he was running as an incumbent,-1,-1
5210,"It was his strongest compared with 2016. Even with COVID, Trump got more votes than he did in 2016.

Incumbent advantage is *incredibly* powerful. There is a reason why almost all presidents get reelected. You really have to screw up pretty bad in order to just be a one-term president.",-1,-1
5211,"Im in my 40s and Independant. My vote was for Bernie. Still wear the Bernie 2020 t-shirt and get a kick out if it because I know the Conservatives won't say anything about it. I've also watched Biden particurlarly closely since the ""Sleepy Joe"" thing started up. He has hands down been the most consequentual president in my lifetime (in a positive getting things done way). 

That president that hasn't done ""that great of a job"", accomplished a jaw dropped amount in 19 months post coup-attempt by the former president and sitting members of Congress.

Edit: For the downvoters, there is now the latest latest economic numbers that came in, as of today. Biden is no doubt now the most positively consequential president in my lifetime

This Youtuber breaks the numbers down well before discussing

https://youtu.be/Lm45BPB-23Y",-1,-1
5212,The senate being what it is Biden deserves monster credit for what has passed. Sinemanchin have been a thorn in the side of democracy for the entire term and the other side of the aisle has no intention of helping Americans.,-1,-1
5213,I would take a 101 year old Biden any time over the sociopath Trump.,-1,-1
5214,I definitely don't want narcissist orange back either. 2020 V2 is not what I want.,-1,-1
5215,Be careful with the videos that get posted on YouTube and/or pushed by Fox News. Find the original anytime you’re curious about veracity. This stuff is going to keep getting worse.,-1,-1
5216,"Meh, it's all I hear about regarding re-electing him.",-1,-1
5217,As a southern democrat this to me would be a dream ticket. I'm from NC and moved to KY. Andy Beshear is a great governor.,-1,-1
5218,"I did research, and I really like Roy Cooper. If there's a shot at Georgia and North Carolina, he's the guy to do it. I also would like a running mate from Pennslyvania so that the map looks like [this](https://www.270towin.com/maps/Rk0op) 

From there, a clear (presidential) plan of attack would be black turnout in Georgia + suburbs in Michigan/ Wisconsin.",-1,-1
5219,"I tend to disagree. First, because we need an incumbent Democratic governor in PA real bad for the next few cycles. Second, because Josh Shapiro is not the man for the job. His coalition skills aren't there. He won because enough Fetterman supporters voted for him while they were at it, and because his opponent was a literal Christian nationalist

That's my viewpoint, anyway. What made you think of Shapiro? Is there anything I'm not seeing? Personally, I'd vote Fetterman any day of the week over Shapiro for the presidency",-1,-1
5220,"I'm confident either the president or VP has to come from Pennsylvania. With that, the map would most likely look like [this.](https://www.270towin.com/maps/n1epw)  If the other person on the ticket is from one of the battleground states indicated, then even better.",-1,-1
5221,"I don’t see that narrative changing anytime soon, though",-1,-1
5222,"Just my opinion. I’d vote for a woman or gay guy, but these older folks aren’t ready for it.",-1,-1
5223,"I would have voted for McCain.. but then he choose that crazy lady to be VP, and I was like dude, you are too old for her to be your VP.",-1,-1
5224,"Tell me where places hire 80+ year olds for a job, besides maybe a store greeter? Also, these older people doesn’t represent the people like younger candidates would, they are going off their experiences from way back in the day. We need new representation, not these old fucks telling us how great this place was back in the day. They don’t understand this culture",-1,-1
5225,"Biden's done a great job, and he absolutely should run because he will get more votes than any other candidate.

First order of business is keeping the GOP out of the White House. That's how we keep the country alive.",-1,-1
5226,"I can say under Trump I wasn’t losing money an saving a hella lot. Under Biden, losing money way faster.  Definitely wasn’t paying excessive prices for anything at all under Trump.  Under Biden, well obviously you already know as well as the rest of the country.   Unfortunately all the old fuks need 2 terms max then kicked to the curb.  
The amount of time they spend in offices and don’t manage to do shit but fuk up more then run for President giving more false bullshit claims to get in the White House.  
Apparently the nonsense history teachers say ”we learn history so that we don’t repeat it” is definitely bullshit cause we keep repeating it 😂",-1,-1
5227,"Maybe that’s the problem, young people don’t generally vote",-1,-1
5228,Contrary to popular belief one can be experienced with out having one foot in the grave. 🤷,-1,-1
5229,You have no idea what your talking about millennial go play Pokémon hahaha,-1,-1
5230,Disagree. But we’ll see what happens! As long as Trump doesn’t win we all win!,-1,-1
5231,"I agree. He even got fucking destroyed on stage with Crist, in his own state.",-1,-1
5232,THANK YOU. And it literally transferred the tax burden to those that are less well off. As if these corporate jagoffs needed more money. Quite the opposite.,-1,-1
5233,Except these zealots have easy access to fire arms and faux news isn’t above inciting violence. That shoe is gonna drop pretty soon.,-1,-1
5234,That’s not how it works. The more zealous they get the more normalized far right politicians become.,-1,-1
5235,"Yeah that I don’t know. He’s charismatic which is a huge plus, but I have no idea how well he could sell himself to more conservative swing states.",-1,-1
5236,we need him to wait and run once we have defeated this antidemocratic insurrection thing dead. It's still way too present of a threat to be dabbling with California Democrats who do gun control legislation. We've got to win so-called moderates in flyover country.,-1,-1
5237,"> whose only qualification is being a straight white man…

Some might argue that's not the California governor's ""only"" qualification.",-1,-1
5238,But muh gaz prizes!,-1,-1
5239,Wait til you hear that he has a penis! And people have SEEN IT!,-1,-1
5240,"I don't see how he's more than okay. He's done some good. He's also been sort of a clown. Imo anyone saying he's great is looking through the lens of how utterly horrific Trump was. We deserve better than Biden, but again this isn't some attack on him.",-1,-1
5241,"Where did I blame the president? I know he alone can’t do it. 

The fact is that nothing that he is pushing for is what I really want (what I listed above)

Also, the president can direct the DEA and FDA to review the scheduling of MJ. He himself can’t legalize it but he can put the wheels in motion.",-1,-1
5242,"True, he's also broken more laws since then (as is a usual occurrence for Trump)",-1,-1
5243,"I don't like how Biden: 

1) Handled the whole railroad potential strike, by taking away their right to strike, over sick leave. This will not help rebuild the middle class. 

2) Housing needs to be addressed.  What they had done and proposed to address is so tiny. 

3) I don't like how he has handled student debt. Education needs to be more affordable. Forgiving X amount of student debt isn't fixing the problem. 

4) When he spoke about Beau dyeing in Iraq. Beau didn't die in Iraq. It left me stunned. I feel for any parent who has lost a child. It left me wondering about his mental state.",-1,-1
5244,"Well, I’m thinking more long term and just spitballing, but him and Beshear came to mind immediately. But he has some it factor.

But look at his electoral history. In 2022, he beat the record for most votes casted for a candidate. The record he beat? Himself in 2016 when he ran for AG. He got more votes than either Clinton or Trump— he got a majority unlike trump’s plurality win. Meaning he had a good crossover appeal. 

He did something right like Jason Kander did in 2016 (even if Kander didn’t win).

EDIT: I forgot Big Gretch? How did I forget her?!",-1,-1
5245,Shapiro got more votes then Fetterman. Shapiro was called night of the election. I think Shapiro carried Fetterman over.,-1,-1
5246,"This. If it's an 80-year-old in the pilot's seat, that's fine, but I'm going to want to know that the co-pilot is ready and able to deal with whatever happens. The pick for VP becomes incredibly important. It's arguably the main reason McCain lost.",-1,-1
5247,A lot of CEO’s are in their 70s and 80s. Warren Buffett is in his 90s. The President essentially is the CEO of the country.,-1,-1
5248,"So we should make elections more like corporate hiring, including all the racism, sexism and ageism?",-1,-1
5249,What do you think Biden specifically did that took more money out of your pocket? Inflation is hitting every country and many much harder than the US.,-1,-1
5250,"Except Trump has the same ""status quo"" bullshit of every other modern republican. No holding corporations accountable for their greed. In fact, Trump literally put a tax plan in place that taxes the middle and lower class more, while giving his rich buddies more breaks. Now the morons in the house want to tax everyone 30%. That's bullshit. The ""you earn more, you pay more"" is infinitely more fair. 

The Reaganism needs to end. Working people are tired of being exploited. The Bern deserved it more than Biden and Trump combined.",-1,-1
5251,"It is a problem, you can vote when you are 16 in Cuba",-1,-1
5252,Totally agree. Are we really talking 25 vs 80? What's wrong with the 40 or 50 year olds? It doesn't need to be so extreme.,-1,-1
5253,"I have every idea what I’m talking about because I’m paying attention. Georgia is just about ready to indict Trump on his election interference back in 2020, DeSantis is tackling POC rights and LGBTQ rights and even trying to take on the mighty Disney for opposing him, Greene and Boebert can’t go five minutes without saying something moronic in the press, on social media or even on the House floor and McCarthy had to practically give away the store to get the gavel. Now, on top of all that, Nikki Haley of all people is about to announce that she’s going to challenge Trump for the GOP nomination for 2024. Considering how much time this woman spent kissing that wrinkled old fool’s pasty white ass, the fact she’s considering taking him on means she doesn’t have any more loyalty for him and thinks she has a chance to beat him.

The Republicans are ripping each other to shreds and you can see it happening every single day. They’re a fractured mess who can’t even agree what direction they want to take the country in while the Democrats are, for the most part, standing in unison and trying to actually govern.

P.S. My go-to is Mario, not Pokémon. But don’t talk about playing Pokémon like it’s a bad thing. My nephews love it when I sit and play it with them.",-1,-1
5254,Maybe but Desantis is a more competent trump which is a low bar but scary nonetheless,-1,-1
5255,"While I understand the concern about armed citizenry harming people, that isn’t really the danger. 

If there is some mass armed uprising, in theory, it’ll be relatively easy to put down. 

The issue is more a legal coup that’s supported by law enforcement, the military and secret service.

It’s pretty clear from January 6 that these organizations are compromised, at least in part. The worry should be that elements of the GOP attempt to force a Constitutional crisis, this is supported by the Supreme Court, the military and law enforcement, OR if there is an armed uprising of some kind, that elements of the military and law enforcement join in support rather than take action to uphold the law.",-1,-1
5256,"Eh, they’ve had plenty of chances to get out the guns. And times with greater leverage for their guy. At the end of the day, I suspect there’s a lot more talk than actual walk from these people.",-1,-1
5257,Really test what “to the death” will mean to them,-1,-1
5258,"Stop worrying about Jim Bob, worry about Jim Jordan.

Jim Jordan has much more power to affect your life than Jim Bob who won't leave his castle/couch.",-1,-1
5259,"Gavin Newsom would be a Beto on the national stage.  

If you want a Republican to win, run Newsom.",-1,-1
5260,"And those same would argue that Kamala as AG from Cali, Senator from Cali, and VP is less qualified than a governor? If not then again I ask what does Newsome have that Kamala doesn’t?",-1,-1
5261,">He's also been sort of a clown.

You need to elaborate and back this up. Exactly in what way? And don't even try to use classified docs.",-1,-1
5262,"""Also, the president can direct the DEA and FDA to review the scheduling of MJ. He himself can’t legalize it but he can put the wheels in motion.""

And he's already done that. https://www.marijuanamoment.net/bidens-health-secretary-gives-update-on-marijuana-scheduling-review-directed-by-the-president/",-1,-1
5263,"1) Wasn't really a good option there and he already tried to bring the two sides together. Probably could have done better. 

2) How does Biden address housing? 

3) There was more to the student loan forgiveness. Student Loans: https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-student-loan-relief-for-borrowers-who-need-it-most/

> Cutting monthly payments in half for undergraduate loans.
Fixing the broken Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). 
Protecting future students and taxpayers by reducing the cost of college and holding schools accountable when they hike up prices.


4) The burn pits in Iraq are probably what gave him brain cancer. He has had a stutter his whole life and is not a good public speaker. Not sure what that has to do with what he has accomplished. 


People are just friggin nit picking at this point. I could name at least this many things for every president we have ever had.",-1,-1
5264,"Again they didn’t get those jobs when they were old, they’ve kept their power throughout their years, lmao.",-1,-1
5265,I’m not saying that,-1,-1
5266,"Lowering the voting age to 16 isn't going to get the 18-29 year olds to vote, those are the ones that aren't voting but are the same ones (for the most part) calling for younger representation.",-1,-1

5270,I’m taking a chance and assuming you’re commenting in good faith; what Democrat would you recommend running if not Biden?,-1,-1
5271,"Newsom has been thoroughly battle tested and is highly effective, unlike Beto, technically You cannot compare the two. They are from two totally different pools.",-1,-1
5272,Because no one likes Kamala.,-1,-1
5273,"I mean, classified docs were just a careless, bad optic, I'm not trying to crucify him for it. I just mean he's had his fair share of gaffes, and I personally don't think he's accomplished THAT much. Approving major oil drilling recently too feels sort of bad. All in all like I said, yes he's ""okay"". I just think it's insane to simply rally behind him and not ask Dems for better.",-1,-1
5274,President Biden has been in politics for 50 years. He just keeps getting promotions.,-1,-1
5275,"You’re right, I wasn’t meaning to make it sound like that would be a solution to the problem we face in the us, I was just trying to point out that age should be less stigmatized when it comes to participating in the political system. Obviously we need people to actually participate to begin with to address that issue",-1,-1
5276,"It may be helpful, though, insofar as it means all high schoolers will have a couple voting years, meaning our schools can play a role in embedding the voting habit early. If Dems could find a way to lower the voting age and push the DoE to really make a strong push for driving high school voter turnout, the surge of youth voter support would be enough to give them an edge in the next elections, and the voters they get from there would continue voting for the next 70 years",-1,-1
5277,Jan 6 would have been much worse if they actually did believe it. Jan 6 was just a bunch of boot licking opportunists. That ship has sailed,-1,-1

5283,"That’s fair. I have some major disagreements with a few of his positions, but he would still be progress and a damn sight better than any Republican.",-1,-1
5284,Buttigieg polls terribly with core democratic voters.,-1,-1
5285,"Whether his fault or not, his resume and reputation have taken a major hit. Travel has been totally fucked up in this country and really blew up with him as Sec of Transportation. He can't explain that away. He needs to end on a good note by sticking it to the airlines and recouping something for the billions in bailouts we gave them, then go do something more successfully before he runs again. 2028 I see him in the running.",-1,-1
5286,A lot of people rightfully don’t like her background as prosecutor and AG.,-1,-1
5287,Shareholders vote for CEOs. We are all the shareholders of America.,-1,-1
5288,They’d probably just have a wide stance on the issue.,-1,-1
5289,"Hell, a lot of them call Buttigieg a diversity hire as Transportation Sec and make jokes about his sexually as it is. And don't forget the blatant and less blatant racism in response to Obama.

I don't think we have another minority president until the boomers have largely died off. There will still be opposition then, but hopefully it won't have the numbers it does now.",-1,-1

President Biden’s first thought was to shoot it down (which was also mine) but he wisely listened to his advisors and didn’t want to shoot down where debis could fall on civilians.    Montana is sparsely populated so I suspect they are being overly cautious that it could contain biological or radioactive material.    China is becoming increasingly aggressive so I am concerned.

And then of course, they could be attacked by planes or missiles, and that’s both literally WW3 and also not the least bit subtle.

The confusing part, to me, is that Russia should have the information PRC would like. Why not just share the info. Is this just a publicity stunt, or is it a tactic to terrorize the public? Is this a warning to the US for supporting Ukraine?

Maybe this balloon is able to gather more information than what PRC’s satellites, or Russia, could gather? Maybe Russia won’t divulge this information to PRC? I know about the ‘games’ Russia and the US play with entering one another’s airspace, but this one has me stumped.

And no one in this Congress has really addressed that issue and I believe that there are many people that came into the Capitol on Jan. 6, whose civil rights and liberties are being violated heavily.”

I would also like to point out that that city is Democrat-controlled and the five officers that have been arrested and charged are Black. And I think that this isn't an issue of racism or anything like that. I think that the judge and the jury in the trial needs to work out what happened there. But I share that with you but I'd like to also point something that I'd hope you share with me. There's a woman in this room whose daughter was murdered on January 6th. Ashley Babbitt.

In fact, Republicans have controlled Texas for about 30 years, so really ANY complaints people have about the state can be laid at Republican feet.

> The poll also found that Gov. Greg Abbott’s approval rating has hit an all-time low.

> Abbott easily won his reelection for a third term in November by 11 points against Democratic nominee Beto O’Rourke.

not directly related to the issues in the article, but its exhausting talking to so many people who continuously complain that 'the system is broken, nothing is getting better, the reps in power dont listen to the people, etc etc' and its like 'did you vote?' always followed with 'no, the system is rigged/broken/predecided/doesnt matter/i dont agree with anyone' etc.

6236,"Texan here and I can confirm.  I have zero faith in Texas democracy.

Ken Paxton, our Attorney General has been under active indictment since 2015 on state securities fraud yet he continues to stay in office.  He actively skirts the legal system he took an oath to uphold by running and hiding from process servers tasked with issuing him subpoenas.

Many of our voting districts are included in the list of most gerrymandered districts in the nation.  This has led to a situation where despite the fact that well over half our population votes democrat, only republicans get elected.

Greg Abbott, our governor, uses this artificial replublican majority to pass state level laws that effectively invalidate city/county level laws passed by more progressive cities.  These laws mandate forced birth on rape victims, prohibit environmental reforms ( plastic bag bans among others ) , restrict cities ability to reform their own police departments, as well as cities ability to reduce gun violence, even in the wake of an unprecedented number of mass killings.

On top of all that, our local elections are flooded with dark money that is used to fund the campaigns of fascist republicans who are dead set on destroying the separation of church and state.

The state is gerrymandered to hell, so votes don't matter the way they should; the leaders cannot be held accountable for their crimes (See AG Paxton) or incredible failures (Abbot + winter = you're gonna have a bad time); I mean what is anyone expecting?

When government cannot meet the basic needs of its citizens, those citizens stop thinking that it's a good thing to have that government. 

Which, in the case of every right-wing pol, is exactly what they want.",-1,-1
6243,"The problem with public education in Texas is that it's not great, mostly because of funding. It's not funded because it's controlled by Republicans who don't want to fund it. (they want  vouchers for credit for private, or religion in school).  So then this cycle starts where people with 'good' kids and money get fed up, pull their kids out of public and go private (or homeschool).  Then the general population of the public school is worse because the smart kid is pulled out.  Then the school is worse off. The teachers are more annoyed dealing with higher percentage problem kids and eventually the teacher(s) leave.  Eventually, the public school becomes a realistic joke, and no one sends their kids there unless they have no other choice because the school is now a 3rd world country.  It's really sad. 

If you have any doubt, look at Houston ISD as an example.  A handful of elementary schools are great.  Even less middle schools.  And very few high schools, honestly maybe 2. 

And the schools that are good, are only good because they rely heavily on PTA donations from parents to provide the things the school actually needs.  Basically the good schools are essentially semi private.  If you think I'm exaggerating, the public school we used to go to with 800 students regularly raised 300-400k in a year.  The bad school next zone over, 8k in a year.  No wonder that school is terrible.

Houston is an enormous city.  This should not be the case.

We overpay for stupid shit like football, baseball,  basketball, but then can't pay for kids to have free lunch at school.  It's embarrassing.",-1,-1

> More than two years since a mob attacked the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, a new survey released Friday found that fewer Texans are certain democracy is the best form of government.

The percentage of those who rated it as poor or terrible increased to 39%. &quot;The reality is it&#039;s impossible to say exactly what led to that, but it&#039;s pretty easy to surmise that the long tail of COVID-related closures and changes to education have had an impact, but also the explicit politicization of K-12 public education with culture war issues,&quot; Blank said.

Batya Ungar-Sargon, opinion editor of Forward, replied to Omar, asking who she thought was ""paying American politicians to be pro-Israel though I think I can guess \[sic\].”

6451,"To elaborate on iknowyouright 's comment, which is quite accurate:

  
The only time the word Semite has been used to refer to ethnic groups in a (semi) academic way is in the context of the eugenics movement. In the 19th century, European racial pseudoscientists were trying to figure out how to place Ashkenazi Jews in their fake racial hierarchy, and labeled them as ""Semites"" to give a scientific-sounding label to their belief that Jews were an inferior race of corrupting foreigners. This is the basic etymology of the word ""antisemitism"". The term has nothing to do with speakers of Semitic languages. Because of its history, the ""Semitic"" in ""antisemitism"" refers specifically to hatred of Jews.

  
Most people you see arguing that ""antisemitism applies to all Semites"" a) don't have a good grasp of the history behind the term b) probably have some kind of incentive to delegitimize or muddy the waters on what antisemitism means... which is usually a bad look.",-1,-1

6501,"Okay so I wasn’t taught false information then…cool. See now, that just brings on more questions. Like why is it antisemitic to make a slur about someone who’s Jewish or the Jewish people, but not a Muslim/Middle Eastern Muslim? Because it would be, technically speaking of what we’re saying is accurate, but I only ever hear it when referencing the former. 

This shit is confusing af and I wish it wasn’t even a thing. I get downvoted and told I’m wrong for this all the time, but I’m cool with hatin on bigots for their views and Nazis are free game for violence (just no death). Besides pedophiles, that’s about as far as I feel hatred should be acceptable. That being said, I wish it would go away. 

Side note: someone yesterday couldn’t quite explain to me in a way I could understand, but they said my views above make me just as much a fascist as a Nazi and a hypochlorite to boot. Is this accurate?",-1,-1

It makes it easy when the fascist side also promises the ultra wealthy more money and power so they have no reason to stop the propaganda spreading across the media corporations they own.",-1,-1
6508,"She used certain phrases that are dog-whistles (and has since apologized for them): “all about the Benjamin’s, baby,”  an allusion to Israel “hypnotizing” the world, suggesting American Jews have a dual loyalty. Intentional or not, words matter, and such phrases are as distasteful to Jews as Trump’s use of “lynching” to describe his perceived harassment was to the black community.

While the sentiment about money in lobbying is fine, the phrasing was definitely not. Which is why she apologized. Omar has come *really* close to the line on several occasions. Things that could be misinterpreted, if under scrutiny. And she’s under scrutiny.

I especially love it when Republicans say I should vote for them because they support Israel. That's cool, but I'm american, not Israel. Israel is a country, Judaism is a religion. I'm not from Israel, I've never been to Israel, so your support of Israel is like #30 on my list of issues.

 Do I think she's an antisemite? Yes. Is she on par with MTG and others in the GOP in terms of magnitude? Note, that I don't think criticism of Israel is antisemitism, but rather her comments, feigned ignorance after being forced to apologize from the Dems, alienation of the 45k Jewish families in her district furthers my conviction that she's an antisemite.

At Israel's Universal Periodic Review in January 2018, Human Rights Watch and other rights groups criticized Israel. Human Rights Watch's Geneva Director John Fisher said, ""Israel's professed commitment to human rights during its UN review is belied by its unwillingness to address human rights violations in the context of the occupation, the rights of Palestinians, or illegal settlement activity."" Ahead of the review, eight Palestinian human rights organizations submitted a joint 60-page report detailing ""Israel’s creation of an institutionalised regime of systematic racial domination and oppression over the Palestinian people as a whole, which amounts to the crime of apartheid, in violation of Article 3 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination"".",-1,-1

6555,"From listening to some of my conspiracy-prone family members talk (especially when it's not about something that has political bs mixed in with it) a lot of it seems to boil down to they just can't handle the fact that sometimes bad things just happen. Sometimes it's an accident, sometimes it's just pure randomness that the bad thing happened.  That sits uneasy with them, they need order and need to understand that there's something or someone in control of it all, whether it be a higher power like god or satan, or some evil cabal making the bad things happen.  

I guess it causes a lack of sense of security to think that at any moment something could just wipe them out at random, so they construct these narratives in their head. 

They haven't openly said any of this, none of them are introspective enough, but that seems to be the base of it for them.

The tweet was widely – and correctly – understood as dangerously antisemitic, particularly heinous in a period of rising anti-Jewish hatred. And whose tweet was this? If you thought the answer was Minnesota’s Democratic representative Ilhan Omar then, well, you’d be wrong. The author was none other than the House majority leader at the time, Republican Kevin McCarthy.

Using your criteria, what makes McCarthy’s tweet “dangerously antisemitic,” other than that it comes from a Republican? He, also, merely mentions billionaires in regards to the election.",-1,-1

Puffy co-founded and co-owns Revolt TV, which decided to air Louis Farrakhan's annual July 4th speeches after Fox Soul dropped him over his antisemitism. Puffy was a part of that decision and has has publicly supported Farrakhan on social media. I don't know about you, but I don't think non-antisemites would give a vicious antisemite a platform on their TV network to promote antisemitism (not to mention homophobia, misogyny, and transphobia).

That said, Rep. Omar used the word ""It's All About the Benjamins"" to discuss Israel lobbying in the US. Considering the antisemitic canard of Jews controlling/owning governments, institutions, media, banks, etc., which continues to put a major target on the backs of Jews, it shouldn't be such a stretch to see why some people would find it problematic. (Even if it was unintentionally done.)

I don't think she's antisemitic. But language matters—especially from our elected officials. By unintentionally stepping her foot in it, she gave the Republicans the opportunity to make her the poster child for antisemitism on the left because she's a Muslim woman of color.",-1,-1

6677,"This article was great - so great that I picked up the book (The Bill of Obligations) immediately after reading it last week.  I'm about 3/4 of the way through the book, and I gotta say I'm pretty underwhelmed.

For all the talk in the article about grounding the ideas that make us American in some sort of common history, the book (so far) absolutely fails to talk about **why** these obligations are important to Americans specifically and **why** this specific set of obligations is American.  Yes, each of the obligations laid out in the book is critical for preserving our democracy, but they apply to any democracy with no mention of what makes them uniquely American values.  Other established democracies around the world have seen similar backslides recently because their citizens are also failing in these obligations.  In other words: the book fails to relate what it means to be an American.

Given the lofty aspirations of the title, I think it's fair to contrast the obligations in this book against the rights protected by the Bill of Rights.  The Bill of Rights is based *directly* on the experience of colonial Americans under the rule of the King.  Every single amendment can be related to a specific historical example of when the King broke a long-standing tradition or law that had historically protected the rights of English subjects.  It speaks directly to the issues that were crucial to Americans (and no other people in the world) at the time it was ratified.

The only thing the author (Richard Haass) does seem to think is uniquely American is our obsession with our rights - which he believes is to the detriment of our society.  The book is a long-form argument that rights alone do not make a democracy.  That's fair, but the entire premise of the American experiment is ""that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--**That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed**[.]""  Our obligations as Americans must start from this premise, and we must be dedicated to protecting the rights of others as strongly as we protect our own cherished rights.",-1,-1

INTRODUCTION

America is a city on a hill. This theme echoes again and again throughout our history. 

“For we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us.” - John Winthrop, 1630

Perry Miller, mid-20th century Harvard University scholar of history, marked the arrival of John Winthrop in 17th century Massachusetts as the birth of America. US presidents took note of Millers’ studies, and almost every president since, from JFK to Biden, has used the vision of the city on a hill to describe America.

I would guess the presidents used the description because it was hard to put into words their vision of America. A standard bearer, the shining example on display for the world to see. 

I believe America is a city on a hill.

America isn’t just a nation of land and people. It’s an ideal of liberty being more final than death. 

What makes America this city on a hill?

A democratic republic that balances rural and urban area influence. Individualism and personal liberty, without imposing on someone else’s liberty. Freedom from, and of, religion. The peaceful transition of power. The pursuit of purpose. The compassion for other Americans demonstrated by FDR. The ability to elevate your social status from humble beginnings. Equality of opportunity. The welcoming of those from around the world who would share our vision and seek individualism and liberty. 

These characteristics of America are the ‘city on a hill’. No matter the course of world events, that American ideal will go on. We need to hold ourselves accountable to the ideal.

You have no need to call me naive. I know America sometimes doesn’t rise to meet our expectations. Nothing reminds me of our challenges more than hearing the 2007 song ‘Hands Held High’ by Linkin Park.

“Ten years old, there's something to see
Another kid my age drug under a Jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought 'the next one could be me'

Do you see the soldiers that are out today?
They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday”

We were embattled in long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Certainly we had missteps. 

We continue to have some missteps today. Gun violence, especially in our schools. Insurrection that threatens our democratic republic. The lack of dignity and grace in our interactions. The 2-party thought that disagreement with someone means their perspective is wrong. 

Despite our challenges, I believe the American ideal is a city on a hill. The shining example for the world. I have seen too much of America, and met too many Americans from coast to coast, to doubt we will see our founding vision again and rise together to meet the challenge. 

In future pieces we can explore what makes America exceptional. Thanks for considering my perspective.

Its a means by which in vs out group think is enabled, and justified too. For many, especially those not inclined to having empathy it is easier to blame, target, and abuse those they deem the ""outsiders"" than to accept, or think about their own moral failings.

Disregard a lot of this comment, I assumed this was a bunch of heavy metal and not easily mistaken for a toy. \]

Original comment:

This is a little too culture-warsy for me.

If the adult product were even _approaching_ being _remotely_ adequately regulated, what would it matter advertising or selling a smaller product for children under those regulations?

Do they not think kids in rural areas are going to be trained to use firearms for hunting/sport/whatever? Would the lack of appropriately sized guns be helpful for those kids to safely train, or would them wielding fully adult-sized rifles or potentially more unwieldy for them (and therefore more dangerous) adult-oriented handguns be  better?

I feel this is both jumping the gun (pardon the expression) in that regulations for safe and responsible use in _general_ should be in place before banning product segments by age group, and because this is _counter-productive_, as the kids are going to be using guns in these families one way or another, and having one sized for a kid to ergonomically hold is actually _much safer_ than them struggling to wield an adult-sized, adult-weight gun.

\[ Edit to add: The risk with kids I feel is much more about the lack of judgment of where to shoot + their inability to aim or have discipline/foresight about where they aim. A least a long rifle like this one is less likely to point in a random direction, due to its length and the ability to get a stable two-point grip on it, and a kid would (I hope) be less likely to carelessly or cavalierly aim something that looks like an AR, compared to the more action-movie/wild-west-staple handgun or whatever.

At least it's not freaking rainbow-colored and looks exactly like a real gun, this thing hopefully isn't fooling anyone into thinking it's a toy (though I admit that could be somewhat of a concern, ~~but it's heavy metal not plastic~~ EDIT: Shit, it's literally plastic, not metal. WTF.). \]

I am not even a gun owner, never touched one, and I can see why this bill would be backward.

The NRA is there solely to distract the public from the NSSF. The NSSF is the firearms industry lobbying and policy group. They give the NRA their marching orders. 

Until the late 1990s the NSSF specifically prohibited their members from marketing military style weapons and equipment to the public. For big name manufacturers they visited licensed dealers and would not allow their firearms to be sold in stores that displayed any products that targeted militia groups/lifestyle or young people. It was adhering to those self imposed restrictions that gave rise to the off brand junk AR-15s of today. 

Below is a link to the NSSF website. They are the people driving the gun culture. They are THE dark money people who own the Congresspeople and judges who give guns to kids, domestic violence perpetrators and the nutters who held state capitals hostage during the pandemic. 

The NSSF needs to be brought to heel.

So are people arguing that while obviously violent video games and movies don't cause kids to commit violent acts, a gun advertisements does?  Because that is some crazy double think.

This is the ideal situation, but is too often not the case. A supposedly secured weapon was brought to school by a 6yo to shoot a teacher. The people most likely to have a kid that would want to hurt someone with a gun are the ones most likely to leave a gun where a kid could get it. Irresponsible people can ruin things for the rest of us, and I don’t trust the average American to make good choices about gun safety, and I definitely don’t trust the complete morons.

7486,"I’d argue that the crickett rifles aren’t any kind of bad thing. Yeah they’re meant for children/smaller people, but the intention seems to be something you can buy on the cheap to teach a kid about firearms.

I did hunters safety as a kid and the thing they drilled into your head was “Firearms are inherently dangerous, do not point them at anything or anybody you do not want to kill or seriously maim” and the same for bows.

Teaching kids about the dangers of firearms as well as how to use them safely leads to people who have more of an understanding of how they function and what you shouldn’t do with them.

Demonizing things leads to them being fetishized, we’ve seen this with AR rifles and firearms as a whole. People who fetishize things tend to be extremists, and extremists are the ones who commit these disgusting crimes.

To set my bias out there, yes I own… a good few firearms. I collect them even. I have about 95% historical 100+ year old firearms or replicas of such. I don’t think there’s anything dangerous about the object, it’s the person. The object empowers some of these people though. 

I enjoy teaching people history and firearms safety though these historical military arms I have. I teach people the functions of the firearm we are using, I shoot it before them and show them how it works and describe the recoil and I always load just a bullet or two. I don’t force anybody to shoot them, just ask. 

So far I’ve taught half a dozen or more people how to shoot and I think only one of them was interested enough to want to shoot again or even own a firearm. That also happens to be my current girlfriend who appreciates the history, so I find that pretty neat.

The solution to gun violence is to teach people how to use guns? Like, even if it's just for safety, it's normalizing guns being so prolific in our culture. And it's circular: shooting happens, its not guns its people, pushes for gun safety but doesn't limit who gets guns, shooting happens (only this time the person was taught how to use the weapon properly)

>do not point them at anything or anybody **you** do not **want to kill** or seriously maim

You do see how that sentence is problematic, right? All it does is tell people ""hey, if you want to kill people, point this at them and pull the trigger""

7514,"You are exactly the type of person that puts fuel into the fire. The type that demonizes things that end up becoming a fetish for those who aren't right in the head. 

By the way you speak of these things I frankly find it hard to believe you have much experience with firearms in general, you appear to think that everyone involved with them just wants to kill people and that's the only reason to have them.

Yes, teaching people that firearms are dangerous is a good thing. You teach respect of such things. You tell a kid not to walk out into the middle of the road, correct? Why? Well, cars don't stop on a dime, cars don't instantly stop for a kid every single time and at the end of the day the child can be taught into knowing all of this and knowing that walking into the road is a potentially dangerous situation. This is why we have cross walks.

Now apply all the same for a kitchen knife, a boat, wildlife, firearms and any number of things you can think of. With nearly everything we do there is a inherent risk, my career is in construction and I've never been injured to any serious degree, but I had seen near fatal injuries that could have been prevented.

I never said anywhere that the solution is to teach people how to use them, more so how they function (negligent discharges are a serious risk of injury or death that does occur), what the results are is safety is not followed and that they are not toys.

But, you home in on just the shooting deaths by people that are crazy enough to intend to go out and kill others. Many of those people are depressed if not mentally ill in some form or another. Many of them kill themselves after such acts, and quite a lot of them have a history of questionable acts throughout their lives that are ignored. 

An inanimate object is not and will not be the cause of anything if it is not used in such a way that it presents any danger to anybody. Cars don't crash into people on their own and we take the risk of being in a car accident any time we drive one, which most people do daily. 

I never denied that firearms don't present some kind of a risk, in fact you cherry picked and edited lines to make it seem the opposite. I even stated that "" I don’t think there’s anything dangerous about the object, it’s the person. The object empowers some of these people though."" which is me actually agreeing that firearms tend to allow people to commit these large scale killings. 

However, these types of people would do it by other means. Vehicles running over people, bombs, knifes, acids, blunt objects, chainsaws, swords and even things such as fire pokers have and will continue to be used. 

Yearly deaths by vehicle crashes, smoking, alcohol, suicide, cancer and obesity continue to individually outweigh the deaths by firearms of any kind.

Most of these issues would seem to be health or mental health issues. These could be solved to a degree by cheaper, more accessible and affordable health care. I know I sure wish I had that as a teenager, for both mental health and physical health, would have made a world of difference and helped with issues I still face today.

I'm quite unsure why you come off so strongly on me, I was only advocating   for education which may help inform people and save lives. Decades ago we did not have this issue, and certainly on a wide scale and yet firearms and ammunition were bought through the mail with no questions asked, no background checks were needed, children brought firearms to school to shoot after school as well as hunt and schools had shooting teams. Some still do, mind you.

So, with easier access to firearms in the past, how is it that in the last thirty or so years we have had this become such a serious problem? I don't have the answers, so please don't snark on me for that one. I have speculations which some of them seem to be common ones, but because I wasn't around back then and because they're just my ideas I tend to keep them to myself.

So once again, taking something away entirely isn't the answer. Look how well that worked for sex, meth, heroine and any number of things (18th amendment) and any other drug in general. If you live near Portland Oregon just go downtown and look around. I try not to anymore, because it's a sad state of affairs. 

I'm really not against you here, I have plenty of ideas that should be done in my opinion and not enough is being done. I actually think some of what is being done is more lip service than anything else, but then we turn the corner and see the US healthcare system and run into the same issues. 

Things need to change, that's for sure. The people who are REALLY into firearms are... Well, the last few gun shows I've gone to have been filled with interesting people..., but a full on ban of something just does not work. If you take something away people will do what they can to get it back or keep doing it, even if they didn't care before. 

I just enjoy functional history, and I'd be sad to let some crazy nutjobs take away my ability to share it with others. Looks like it's headed that way though, because I'm just lumped in with the rest of the lot.",-1,-1
7515,"To your last part, there was a video of a guy here the other day that shot a guy who was speeding down his road. The guy who would shoot him yelled at him as he drove by. The guy backed up and asked what the guy was yelling about while he got out of the truck to talk to him. After a very brief talk, the guy shot the unarmed speeder in the chest. As he tried to get back to his vehicle, the guy decides (which he later admitted) that he assumed the guy he shot was going back to his car to shoot back at him. So he did the only thing he could; he put 3 more rounds into his back. He then screamed at the dying man/corpse, went through his things, moved his own truck (which was partially in the road) into his driveway, called the police, and claimed he was almost shot and had to defend himself.

7588,"> So why does the trending phrase have the word “Jewish” in front of it? Well, Taylor Greene’s post suggested that the Rothschild banking firm is behind a supposed corporate cabal that engineered this whole space laser plot. Ah, of course, the old Rothschild family explanation again. As Zack Beauchamp wrote for Vox, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about the Rothschild family controlling the world have frequently surfaced in the past. Beauchamp explained that this was not “an isolated anti-Semitic incident for Greene.” In fact, the Editorial Board for USA TODAY wrote that “her Facebook account contained racist, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic views,” which doesn’t sound very nice. Beauchamp stated that Taylor Greene’s “space laser” theory is “the latest in a long line of conspiracies about the Rothschild family, and those conspiracies are always, at root, anti-Semitic: Since the 19th century, people have used claims that this one particular wealthy family controls the world to cast aspersions on Jews in general.”

And as far as your earlier examples, let's put in in the form of some very neglected US history questions:

What did Nixon call the Birchers again?    How did he respond to them in his 1962 gubernatorial campaign?

What did William F. Buckley write in the National Review about Jack Welch?  Were his statements supported in any way in any congressional statements from GOP leadership in 1965?

How did Eisenhower basically end McCarthy's overreach using the powers of the Executive branch?

There was a time the GOP kept their kooks in the fringes because the necessities of the cold war required it.  As a bunch of simpletons (or to quote Barry Goldwater about his own supporters:  ""commie-haunted apple pickers"" and ""cactus drunks"") the GOP was easier to keep in line when facing a clear external threat because that's how their pea brains are wired.

She wrote a November 17, 2018, Facebook post -- which is no longer available online -- in which she said that she was speculating “because there are too many coincidences to ignore” regarding the fire, including that then-California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) wanted to build the high-speed rail project and “oddly there are all these people who have said they saw what looked like lasers or blue beams of light causing the fires.” She also speculated that a vice chairman at “Rothschild Inc, international investment banking firm” was somehow involved, and suggested the fire was caused by a beam from “space solar generators.” 

Greene added: “If they are beaming the suns energy back to Earth, I’m sure they wouldn’t ever miss a transmitter receiving station right??!! I mean mistakes are never made when anything new is invented. What would that look like anyway? A laser beam or light beam coming down to Earth I guess. Could that cause a fire? Hmmm, I don’t know. I hope not! That wouldn’t look so good for PG&E, Rothschild Inc, Solaren or Jerry Brown who sure does seem fond of PG&E.” 

So yes. You’re right. She never said the words “Jewish Space Lasers” in the post. However that’s exactly what she meant. It’s a dog whistle and you’re over there saying, “what? I don’t hear a whistle.” And still expect people to take your semantics argument seriously…",-1,-1

8001,"The investigation bore fruit though, it wasn't some nothing that shouldn't have been looked into. It was an investigation done by Republicans, obstructed by Republicans and ultimately handed over to Republican politicians. It's not surprising that the obstruction charges weren't pursued by Trump's AG or the GOP majorities in the House. And it was proven that Trump *tried* to collude with the Russians (see Donald Trump Jr's meeting with them), it's just that they had no dirt to offer. The Trump campaign did appeal to Russia to hack the DNC and release damning emails, which they did. And the Republican head of the FBI did release stuff about Hillary's emails (which turned out to be nothing) just before the 2016 election which almost surely did impact the results. 

But go ahead and compare all of that to the millions of Republicans (both voters and elected officials) who think Democrats drink the blood of babies, cause apparently they seem equivalent to someone like you.",-1,-1
8002,"Because most functioning adults are aware of things called implication, inference, and nuance. 

By your logic, if I tweeted out: “a certain orange skinned former president may have done a twosie in his diaper” I could reasonably, accurate claim “I never said Donald Trump shit his pants” and that’s a reasonable response to you? And it makes a significant difference? 

She claimed that a well known Jewish family was investing in “energy satellites” and that blue lights were seen beaming from the sky before the fires. Thereby obviously, heavily implying that the fires were started by those lasers, those lasers from space, those lasers from space that she attributes to a known Jewish family.

8046,"Did you read the article?

The IRS focus on lower income audits that happen automatically and by mail is precisely because the IRS is underfunded and understaffed, as it's too expensive and requires too much manpower to go after rich tax cheats and complex tax schemes.

>Audit rates plummeted across the board after the GOP took back Congress in 2010 and proceeded to eviscerate the IRS’s enforcement budget. From 2011 to 2017, audits of EITC claimants declined by about 45 percent, but **audits of taxpayers reporting income of $500,000 or more fell way more steeply**—by as much as 78 percent.

>Starved of funding and accounting manpower by Republican lawmakers, the IRS bean-counters **all but gave up on complex, high-dollar audits in favor of automated audits by mail—which now make us some 70 percent of all audits**, and which the authors emphasize are “substantially cheaper” and “can be particularly burdensome for lower-income households.”

>Last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, which not a single congressional Republican supported, replenished the IRS’s coffers with almost $80 billion over 10 years. **The enforcement component (roughly $46 billion) is expected to yield a 450 percent return by restoring the IRS’s ability to collect the taxes owed by rich Americans**—including former president Donald Trump—who were rarely audited on his watch. Congressional Republicans are trying to repeal the new funding via the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act—a curious moniker for a bill that would mainly protect tax *cheaters*.

>The House bill also aims to claw back $403 million from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, a watchdog that generates reports such as this one, noting that **the IRS had failed to collect more than 60 percent of 2019 taxes—some $2.4 billion—still owed by delinquent individuals with incomes of $1.5 million and up**. In 2020, the Inspector General reported that **nearly 880,000 “high income” non-filers from 2014 through 2016 still owed the government $46 billion—and that the 300 biggest delinquents owed about $33 million per head, on average.**",-1,-1
8047,"Or you could read the article, or even the source paper it's referring to:

>Black taxpayers, **who accounted for an estimated 21 percent of EITC filers, were selected for 43 percent of the audits**. Now, IRS staffers don’t sit around deciding whom to audit—the selection is algorithmic and nominally race-blind. But the agency’s secret sauce somehow produced results that are far from colorblind.

>Lacking access to the code—which is indeed secret—the authors tried out different models to make sense of the disparity, and suggested ways that the IRS might fix the problem. Race-wise, for instance, one gets very different results using an algorithm that emphasizes the likelihood of any under-reporting of income by EITC claimants vs one that emphasizes the magnitude of under-reporting. Stanford, one of the institutions involved, has a good summary here.

8076,"It is less about the *IRS* as an organization “not caring” or anything of that nature. Rather, it is the rules (the law) that Congress passes. 

The IRS as an organization is very much built around the rules. Following the rules, knowing the rules, enforcing the rules, etc. Exceptions do exist. But the rule is that the rules exist and must be followed. They also don’t like how the Congress has grossly over-complicated the tax code. Reading some of the IRS reports and studies is a fascinating exercise; they are frustrated as an organization and as people who pay taxes themselves. 

If we want change we have to go through the legislative process. Unfortunately.

For example, the IRS is certainly best positioned to process the overwhelming majority of tax filings. But it isn’t allowed to. Why? Because there are multi billion dollar enterprises built on filing taxes and portions of those revenues fund campaigns. Plus, distrusting the taxman is kind of central to the American story and ethos. 

When was the last time you looked at your withholdings and thought “hell yeah! Doing my part! Woo!” Never. The answer is never. 

Or when was the last time we met an IRS agent and thought “man, that person is doing it right. Making sure everyone is contributing to all the goods and services afforded to us just by living in this country.” Never. 

The point is, Congress needs to be held accountable for the decades of crap they have added to the tax code.",-1,-1

>Black taxpayers, who accounted for an estimated 21 percent of EITC filers, were selected for 43 percent of the audits

What is *actually happening* is a racially disparate and unjust outcome as a result of ostensibly neutral policy and methods. It's not an ""appearance"" of systemic racism. It is an *example*.

8087,">I didn't think of it before but people who accept the hypothetical IRS-prepared return and tax bill would not be eligible for audit.

And **that's** why it's a horrible system which won't get implemented.

Situation:

IRS prepares taxpayer A's income tax return (ITR), based on their W-2 wage income.  Credits them for their withholding, and taxpayer A is found to be eligible for a refund of $500.  Taxpayer A knows there is undisclosed income (we'll get to this in a second) and readily accepts the return / refund.

IRS prepares taxpayer B's ITR.  Treats taxpayer B the same as taxpayer A, taxpayer B has wages, and gets withholding, and is offered a refund of $500.

Taxpayer B disputes this.  The IRS didn't give him credit for his mortgage interest!  He has a private mortgage to taxpayer A, and has paid $20,000 of mortgage interest to taxpayer A.  He demands the IRS give him proper credit, and the IRS, being bound to the law, does so.  Taxpayer B's refund after the mortgage interest deduction is increased by $750.

Now the IRS, armed with adequate records to make proper assessment, turns back to taxpayer A, who has $20,000 of undeclared interest income, and owes an additional $250 of income taxes.  And they can't do anything.

This is called an Assessment in the Alternative situation; there is a liability which may be assessed to more than one person.  One person's deductions are typically another person's income (excepting for personal deductions - standard deduction, exemption deduction).

**That's a problem.**  This system would cost the state a lot of revenues.",-1,-1
8088,"This might make me sound strange, but I don't mind paying my share of taxes—note that I say this as a socialist.  For reference, my household's federal income tax liability is about $20k a year, give or take.  My wife is a Soldier and I see how government spending has helped regular folks (especially younger Servicemembers) make a decent living and provides needed services.

Similarly, my state tax liability is about $6k.  Again, I never mind paying it and my state does a damn decent job of providing needed services at that level.

And my wife's late friend (died in the 2000s) was an IRS agent who was a decent and kind person who did her best to help the average taxpayer.  My mother-in-law had positive interactions with the IRS a few years ago when she needed to sort out some issues with her small business taxes.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that there are some exceptions.

Edit to add: I do agree that some simplification of the tax code is needed.  I don't work in that area (as my full-time role is in telecom), but surely there are improvements that can be made.",-1,-1

8093,"Race shouldn't even be in the conversation. Our detection and enforcement should focus on reducing the number of false positives and increasing the number of true positives. When crafting detection methods we shouldn't count non-white false positives as double, or increase the threshold for flagging those who are non-white. The IRS doesn't need to know your race.

We shouldn't avoid detection methods that reduce false positives because it benefits whites, or increases true positives because it impacts non-whites.",-1,-1
8094,"That does not follow.  Systemic racism is still fundamentally racism.  Targeting a particular subset of the population based on valid metrics that just happens to coincide almost exactly with a single racial minority is not a good look, but it isn't automatically racism.  It could still be valid.  You may want to change it anyway because a less efficient outcome is more desirable than the appearance of impropriety, but that's not the same as it actually being systemic racism.",-1,-1
8095,"I'm not exactly understanding how the IRS would not be able to audit. While this isn't current law, any theoretical implementation would have the taxpayer swearing under penalty of perjury that the return the IRS prepared is correct to the best of their knowledge, and I would know of no clear reasoning that would define the IRS as being ineligible to press further in under- or unreported income scenarios.

The concept being discussed is not the same as a substitute for return (SFR).",-1,-1

I am generally of the same opinion actually. Maybe we should start a viral thing? That would be wild.",-1,-1
8097,"The answer will depend on the country we are referring to, but 1 the only people having their taxes done automatically while being accurate and complete would have equally simple tax returns in the US that can be completed in 15 minutes, and 2 many of those countries handle subsidies differently. We don't like the word subsidy in the US, so instead of granting subsidies on the front end, we grant tax credits and deductions on the back end.

An example would the tax credits you can receive for adding solar panels to your home. As the system currently stands, you need to pay for the solar panels in full up front, and then get your subsidy on the back end when you file your tax return. If instead the subsidy was applied on the front end and your solar panels where simply 30% cheaper to the consumer, and the US government pays the additional 30% to the manufacturer upfront, you wouldn't have to apply for the tax credit on the backend simplifying your return.",-1,-1

8129,"Republicans don't even give a shit about their representatives governing. They literally just want them to start culture wars and dish out hits on societal things that they find offensive. Take DeSantis here. Dude has no accomplishments as governor; nothing important legislative, and nothing important economically.

8130,The worst thing College Board could do was back down. They should have just pulled the class in Florida. No one wants a watered down bullshit class on African American history. There’s already enough of that to go around.,-1,-1
8131,Other states should ditch the college board.  Screw them.,-1,-1
8132,"My hope is the universities will choose not to honor this class.  They don’t have to accept AP credits and a big part of doing so is a review of the curriculum to ensure it meets with the university standards for that topic and match it to a particular class in the university catalog.  I don’t know how any decent university can look at the new curriculum and say it actually covers this topic with any level of integrity.

I am sure Florida Universities will take it, and most of the south, but hopefully some very big noteworthy ones will publicly refuse to accept that credit towards a degree program.",-1,-1
8133,"The College Board and Ron DeSantis deserve one another.  The College Board is made up of greedy corporatist sycophants who will bend over for whomever will promise them a reliable market share and relevance.  DeSantis, like all fascists, feeds on sycophancy, and can now boast that he made the pointy headed woke intellectuals back down. Of course, he did no such thing, but scarcely anyone will appreciate the difference.",-1,-1
8134,Critical theory isn't even taught below graduate school.  Republicans are shameful in their moral panic to ban it.,-1,-1

8138,"I'd go further. Pull AP as a thing completely; it's just a scam for College Board. For example, med schools don't like AP credit, but the students who are looking at med school are precisely the sorts of students who will take AP. High schools don't tell them that they are weakening their future application because they want to boast about the percentage of their students who take AP. 

Part of what I do is admissions. I don't give a shit if a student has taken an AP class. I also don't care if you gave CB money so you can take the SAT. Let's move on past this bullshit.",-1,-1

8142,"This is a terrible proposal.  This creates perverse incentives that can cause harm to inmates who feel that there is no way out other than to donate organs.  We shouldn't create incentives like this that make people have to weigh donating organs vs being treated with dignity.  This is completely unethical.  I'm more in favor of community service, rehabilitation/therapy courses, or heck even working in a high demand sector in exchange for reduced sentence such as paramedic, fire fighter, rural doctor, educator in low income areas ect.

8171,"Agreed. There’s already enough incentive to imprison people for either non violent or straight up false charges with our for profit prisons and broken labor system.

Rural Doctors, Fire Fighters, Paramedics, and educators in poor communities are hard to find because working in these careers is very stressful even if it is rewarding.  If we didn't have a shortage of people then they wouldn't be on this list.  Extending lifelines to people to help them rejoin their communities is the best way to prevent recidivism.  It also boost the economy.  Think of this as a combination rehabilitation, parole, and community service.  We already provide education services to prisoners.  I'm just saying give them an option to train for high demand, Low Applicant, community oriented careers in exchange for a shorter sentence. I think this would help enrich the lives of convicts but also help them reintegrate into their communities which should be the ultimate goal of any type of criminal justice system. Separate them from society and then rehabilitate them so they can be reintroduced and be productive members.  This isn't always possible but that is why we have life sentences without parole.

This zero sum mindset is what prevents us from having a better society.  I'm sorry your DUI prevents you from getting the opportunities you want.  You deserve an opportunity for rehabilitation and redemption like these prison inmates.  That doesn't mean that we shouldn't have this service because you would benefit from it too if our criminal justice system was rehabilitation oriented rather than punishment oriented.  You were punished but given no opportunity to correct your mistake.  Social services such as free/low-cost healthcare, education, Child care,  and housing benefit everyone by allowing people to live their best lives and become productive members of society.  This allows them to start families, generate wealth and contribute to the economy which then we all benefit from.",-1,-1

…

> State Rep. Anna Eskamani released a statement to Orlando Weekly late Friday afternoon, condemning the state's actions in no uncertain terms. ""Governor Ron DeSantis’ culture wars are destroying people’s jobs and livelihoods. The very notion of shutting down a small business over a drag show is insane and extreme,"" said Eskamani. ""In the United States we do not allow the government to determine what we can read, see or hear or who we can gather with.

>The state has asked these questions for about two decades, according to reports.


And most states (44/50) request/require the asking of female high school athletes for information about their periods.

&nbsp;

The American Academy of Pediatrics encourages this because:

>“Female athletes/athletes with uteri who are not having menstrual periods are at increased risk of stress fractures,” Carl said.

&nbsp;

And other states do weird shit too:

>Among other states, **Massachusetts** does currently suggest an **examination of “genitalia.”** Other states also suggest genital examinations, some of them like Oklahoma and Michigan singling that out for “males only,” or like New York asking if male athletes “have only one testicle.”

&nbsp;

What is weird about Florida is that some states only require the doc signs a form sent to the government that says the athlete is cleared for sports. 

For some weird reason, Florida wants the menstrual info as well - *but always has* as fair as I can tell. 

That should definitely be changed. But I still think that we need docs clearing athletes for sport - in a way that values their privacy.",-1,-1

People have such a short term focus and are unable to make temporary sacrifices to avoid longer term agony. One of these times, the recession will turn into a full blow depression where fiscal stimulus is insufficient to revive the economy.",-1,-1

Spending is the primary driver of inflation, of that there is no doubt. The fed hawks on this like there’s no tomorrow but they’re ignorant to the fact of why and how people are spending. People are spending at a higher rate because prices are high or are prices high because people at spending at a higher rate. The fed looks at these two things the same way even though they’re two completely different sets of circumstances that came before either scenario. Also the fed doesn’t have many tools to do anything aside from make money more expensive to borrow. Kind of like the movie Office Space, they don’t fire Milton, they just fix the glitch and figure it’ll work itself out on it’s own.",-1,-1

8585,"Quantitative easing, or QE, refers to policies that substantially expand the size of the Fed’s balance sheet. Quantitative tightening, or QT, refers to the opposite—policies that reduce the size of the Fed’s balance sheet.

QE just added a few trillion dollars of U.S. Bonds to the FEDS portfolio so they wouldn't be absorbed by the market. Stimulates the economy be freeing up bond money for other investments. None of that puts money into the average consumers pocket to drive up inflation. Now the FED is allowing those bonds to mature and selling some back. It all comes out even in the end.

8590,"I dont understand how your response changes anything about what I said, the idea that inflation is being caused by workers having too much money to spend is absurd and I really dont care whether the fed are useful idiots or part of the grift, the end result is the same... cruelty is enacted on the average american.",-1,-1
8591,"QE creates more money in the economy.  The mechanisms are inconsequential, the final effect is that there is more money.  Your description of bond purchases is only a partial view - what happens is much more complicated, in that it makes bonds less attractive for investment with low rates, and more importantly stimulates more borrowing and debt through increased available liquidity.  Influenced by low interest rates, this cascades through the financial system to create more money in circulation throughout the economy.

The historically low interest rates and new reserve model for banking introduced circa 2008 means that money reserves are no longer required.  The money multiplier doesn't even really hold things back like it once did, as [the fed will always cover bank reserves](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/page1-econ/2021/09/17/teaching-the-linkage-between-banks-and-the-fed-r-i-p-money-multiplier).

Also the fact that I'm not a hateful ghoul bent on discriminating against other people means that I would never support them or want them to do well but Jesus, that is such a stupid plan and is basically a cop out because of their severe intellectual limitations.

Then they went for sports, the one thing I know enough about to know isn't an issue but I thought would never get over that hurdle in my lifetime. They've had some successes, but look how esoteric it is. And the spotlight led to a lot more people realizing the hard facts like how long most leagues have already been inclusive.

Now the kids. This treatment is horrific, yes. Just like every older generation of trans folk had to face. Looking at the state of things now though, seems like a lot of trans youth even in ruby red states are looking at what was best case scenario for Milennials.

I went on DDG and scrolled through two pages of articles and the popular consensus is that it's for scientific weather analysis - the ONLY articles I seen that were fear mongering about it was Fox and their affiliates with wild theories about sabotaging airplanes and being 'close to its final target'.

It's unfortunate that the balloon is Chinese because that is simply an easy way to twist this into political gain by spreading fear and irrational 'what if's?!?'.

I seen an article where China was actually asking America to not turn this into more than it actually is - which they claim is strictly science. I seen the theories coming from a mile away as soon as I heard it was Chinese. If it were from 90% other countries, this would just be a quick news blip if that.

And I'm not sure what China would do if an American weather balloon floated over their airspace. I'm sure they would at the VERY least do some sabre rattling and shit talking about their nukes or whatever.

Pretty much. Under Abbott and Paxton, Texas has had a surge in sexual assault cases and its clearance rate has dropped by 18%.

When he passed an abortion bill, someone asked Abbott if Texas would force a female rape victim to give birth to her violators child.

Abbott basically said that question was moot because Texas would make ending rape ""priority one."" So no rape victim would have to give birth to her rapists child because there would be no rape kn Texas.

The opposite happened. Cases went up. Clearance rates ticked up like 2% into the 20's, lagging the national average by double digits

Paxton and Abbott are failing to deal with Texas' sexual crime problem, so they just blame it on gays and trans people instead.

9282,"Texan here. He’s technically correct in that it’s not a power source problem but appears to be a tree branch problem (maintenance problem). Looking at the power outage map there are hundreds of outages in my county, all are small (1 family up to 180 families) and scattered throughout the county. 

It’s still his fault though. We lose power because of tree branches several times a year and the government needs to put pressure on the electric utilities to either start burying the lines or spend money on better tree limb clearing.

9325,"Late last year most of my state lost power due to severe winds and ice building up on power lines.  My neighbor and I both had our powerline ripped off our house, it was a freak event.  There were several hundred thousand outages reported in the state with only 630,000 people so most homes and businesses lost power for at least a period of time.  Vermont utility companies had about 95% of the power back on in the state within 48 hours because the problem was power transmission not power generation.  Utility providers had linemen from Canada, Maine and New Hampshire here as a precaution because of the extreme weather and it paid off. 

Texas can’t keep up with generating enough power, that’s damning.  But that’s what you get when you intentionally cut yourself off from the west and east coast power grid to avoid federal regulation and then people freeze to death in temperatures us New Englanders considered balmy.  Because our homes tend to be better insulated, I didn’t have to leave home for 36 hours until the house we can excessively cold and wouldn’t of had to leave at all if I gotten my chimney sleeved in time before winter.",-1,-1

In his words ""how do Texans live like that we haven't lost power in years""

In Texas's defense, they said it was chilly, maybe in the 40s at night.  I know that when my city gets cold snaps we always have iss....oh wait no I don't live in a red state shit hole so we lose power once every 5 years for an hour when wind blows a tree into a transformer or some shit.",-1,-1

They are what most would consider traditional American evangelicals and would watch the world burn if it meant no abortion and no gay marriage. It’s a long explanation that goes deep into decades of conditioning. Hatred of certain groups have become such a part of their identity over a long long period of time they have an existential crisis, if they start to question these long-held beliefs so they won’t. Questioning their “faith” is considered heretical and makes them feel bad; that sort of thing. Having grown up in the same church, and studied religion pretty extensively in college I am pretty familiar with their stated beliefs.

I have a few friends who didn't vote because they thought things that ranged from:

1. I don't have the time
2. My vote doesn't matter so why bother?
3. Beto is just as bad as Abbott
4. Beto wants to send in IRS agents to take my *antique non-functional* guns (yes, one person actually believed this because he listens to his crazy MAGA dad).

It was beyond infuriating. Even for my friends that that thought Beto was just as bad or horribly misinformed, I told them to at least vote for local elections and vote out Paxton, but they were convinced that because Beto was bad it meant everyone was bad.

Forgot to mention the friend was worried Beto wanted to take his antique completely non-functional guns.

One in every science class from elementary to university, to ensure science takes a second seat to creationism and American Exceptionalism.

One in every high school class to ensure critical thinking skills are suppressed.

One in every church, to ensure donations to political pacs are stimulated, and that the pastor/minister makes sure to tell the congregation to vote GOP, because Democrats are literal demons.

It may play well in the base, but I'd wager that for the most important swing demographic of suburban white voter, stuff like attacking trans-children and critical race theory is not helpful. Plus although culture issues drive the republican  base, it also will drive democrat turnout.

DeSantis is terrifying to moderate Republicans and independents too. If I were Kamala, I'd want to run against him in 2028. She has a canned speech about being part of the first generation of black kids to attend desegregated schools and DeSantis is currently trying to destroy African American studies.

On average she has voted with Biden and Obama more often than she has voted with Trump.

She shifted to be much closer to a typical Senator with regards to party-line votes after Trump was elected, but that is most likely because it was the first time in more than a decade that the GOP had a united government.

Your manager may force you to transfer departments or reduce your responsibilities but they won't fire you for playing on your phone all day.

An equal tragedy is our main stream media who are already dangerously normalizing him just like they did with Trump and are treating the coming fascism as entertainment.

They're getting a paycheck and health insurance for life, even after they retire, and it's being paid out of your taxes even if you didn't vote for them.""

Ads like that probably wouldn't get air time on any platform most MAGAs visit, but there are sensible Republicans who actually might see what's going on.

Yeah. Totally.",-1,-1
10962,"You're not going to change the American car culture with tax credits for bikes, Jesus Christ. You might personally not like them (I also don't even own a car), but people need their cars to commute to work and pick up kids from school, then go to the grocery store. Good luck doing that on a friggin' bike.

I hate this argument so much. We've had a century of polluting fossil fuel vehicles and now that we're finally kicking that habit, you get people like you siding with the fossil fuel shills in opposing EVs.",-1,-1
10963,"You stated the problem, no bike paths anywhere. Kids should be able to have the option to walk or bike safely to their schools without having to worry.

Every morning I drive past families waiting on the school bus (in their cars too at the corner) to take the kids 3/4 of a mile to the elementary school or 5 miles to the high school.

Walking and biking paths that went from the living area to the destinations would take the car traffic away from the school area.

Walking and biking near-utopias exist, look at the Las Vegas strip, Disneyland. Everyone wants to go there and leave the cats behind because driving is a hassle.

Making driving to school a hassle and other modes of transport will arise.",-1,-1
10964,">so the school run or getting groceries or anything even remotely close 

Yes. It isn't the answer to everything, electric bicycles aren't single answer. My job is a +30 commute by car (and mostly highway and early), I recognize that an electric bicycle won't solve this, I will require more for my daily commute. However, there are **a lot** of short trips and regular errand runs that I perform that don't require a car, but are far enough to make an electric bike an undeniably better option. 

A majority of the US population cannot afford a new EV SUV, or any EV, even with the tax credits. In contrast, the vast majority of the US population would use electric bikes daily if there was no barrier to ownership. 

I'm willing to use myself as an example, I'm not better than anyone else. My commute by bicycle to work is not feasible, and remote work is not an option, so I still very much need a car at this time. However, I also use my SUV to run almost all my errands. Yes, I am lazy, I admit I am the problem. All that considered, if i received a tax credit that essentially resulted in a free (to me) electric bike, I would use it daily for all my errands. It isn't a total solution, but it would be far more effective",-1,-1
10965,">A majority of the US population cannot afford a new EV SUV, or any EV, even with the tax credits.

Obviously not, it's still a nascent market. But policy works with future goals in mind and this will change over the coming decade. Can't achieve affordability for a brand new product overnight, that's not how any of this works.",-1,-1

11002,Can’t imagine why red states struggle so hard in so many areas…,-1,-1
11003,"Backstory: Texas is full of ""Leadership Academies"" backed by Lizzie DeVos, yes the sister of Eric Prince of Blackwater fame, Drumpf's former Sec. of Education. They take public money to offer education in competition with public schools. Unfortunately, their students do worse on standardized tests than public school students.

It's just part of the ongoing Rethuglican effort to make a profit by destroying public education.",-1,-1
11004,"Right now in PA, the fucking charter school vultures are giving away computers to anyone who signs up for remote learning with them. They're advertising on popular podcasts and during the NFC/AFC championships on TV. It's literally just fucking embezzlement.",-1,-1
11005,Texas and education shouldn't be allowed in the same sentence.,-1,-1
11006,...And the GOP puts another nail in the coffin of public education.,-1,-1
11007,"Lmfao that’s it folks, it’s all over.  What a shithole",-1,-1
11008,no surprise their education is subpar,-1,-1
11009,Must have just found out about that “Wonderful Nazi” school program.,-1,-1
11010,"This just hurts my soul because the last governor who actually cared about schools was a teacher. It’s been nothing but lip service, riding on fumes, and now cutting the nose to spit the face. Richards is rolling in her grave…",-1,-1
11011,Jesus is gonna be locked and loaded in a few generations. Fuck the GOP.,-1,-1
11012,Good. I should have say where my tax dollars go. My school taxes go directly to the ISDs and are not being used to their fullest. Time to allow me to control where it goes.,-1,-1
11013,"Do you also have a say in what vehicles the military buys? No.

The taxes are used to fulfill the constitutional requirement to educate children. Giving away money to random third parties doesn't help solve that problem because those schools by necessity will cost more and have a profit motive rather than being directly dedicated to education. Besides that, since they're not required to take all children, they will necessarily require there to be two school systems funded by taxes, the private one and the public one which takes all the kids the private schools don't want to take.  Does paying twice for the same education make sense financially to you? Nope.",-1,-1
11014,"that’s why I won’t pay twice. i’m forced to allow the mediocre school to educate my kid.  or i pay (twice)for private or even a quality homeschool program. give me my voucher for schooling and let me be. besides… the indoc going on in these schools is criminal. 

No more the day where I or anyone for that manner should trust the govt to educate our children. there was a time where teachers were unbiased and in the middle. never pushing agenda.",-1,-1
11015,"By indoc, you mean the school's refusal to indoctrinate your kids into believing the gays and blacks are bad, Trump is king, and MAGA is right.  The middle to you is an average episode of Tucker.",-1,-1
11016,">that’s why I won’t pay twice

Wait til you find out about the roads you don't drive on that your taxes pay for...",-1,-1
11017,well. where i’m at the roads are on point. the county does a great job. but when a significant chunk of my property tax is for the ISD. and their marks are mediocre. that’s my frustration.,-1,-1
11018,AOC to GOP: Don't tell me you're condemning anti-Semitism when a Republican 'who has talked about Jewish space lasers' gets a plum committee assignment,-1,-1

11020,Republicans talk out both ends and it smells equally as shitty.,-1,-1
11021,"its just like everything, they dont actually believe in anything or have any sincerely held beliefs. they dont care about women, until they use them in discussing trans issues. they dont care about children, until they use them in abortion discussions. they dont care about the constitution, until they bring up the 2nd amendment... etc, etc.

the will just feign outrage over any topic that will get their base worked up but they have no consistency or substance",-1,-1
11022,The Republican Party is turning into everything they tell their base they're fighting against. What a bunch of bitchy little hypocrites.,-1,-1
11023,"How long is it going to take for people to realize we have a fully formed and functioning neo-Confederacy flush with cash from the oil industry and Christian Nationalists, who are focused on destroying democracy, rolling back civil rights, undermining the rule of law, and turning the US into an authoritarian surveillance state?",-1,-1
11024,Why keep focusing on this silly comment and Paul Gosar's anime video? Marj and Paul Gosar are both on committees and have both spoken at white nationalist conferences. Call it out for real.,-1,-1
11025,"i mean, remember that time they were cool with the guys with torches screaming about jewish replacement?",-1,-1
11026,100% right.  MTG should be no where near *any* committee.  It's ridiculous.,-1,-1
11027,Republicans do not belong in government at all,-1,-1
11028,"Nobody actually believes any of the GOP bullshit ""reasoning"". Republican politicians are posturing for power, the base sees it like entertainment, just another an episode of WWE.",-1,-1
11029,"Hastily taking off his makeup, George Santos denied that he was responsible for the space lasers, apparently walking back his ""Jew-ish"" affiliation.",-1,-1
11030,"Here's the thing, if Fox News doesn't tell them about it then they have no clue that it is even happening. 

A friend of mine who is all about Hunter Biden and his laptop, had no clue who George Santos was. Like no clue. This was last week. 

Talk about living in a bubble.",-1,-1
11031,Or when a huge part of your demographic involves Neo nazis and other white supremacists.,-1,-1
11032,The GOP has no credibility when it comes to statements - they are intentionally destroying democracy. The Dems are playing by the old rules,-1,-1
11033,AOC seems unaware of the GQP-KKK approved list of antisemitic tropes. Anything Jewish remotely related to Christian End Times is sacrosanct. Anything else remotely Jewish is fair game for criticism to calumny.,-1,-1

11036,"Republicans are a hate group.  People gotta start calling it out, none of this tap dancing around it.  Just...say...it.  They are a party that supports racism and bigotry and white superiority.",-1,-1
11037,This just in: everything the Republicans say is random nonsense to emptily advance what they want to do. There is no substance and they don’t give a shit if they get “called out” on it because getting called out results in literally zero consequences. Zero.,-1,-1
11038,Her speech on the floor today was awesome.,-1,-1
11039,The GOP loves Israel but they hate the Jews.,-1,-1
11040,She is the type of person I want to represent me in government. Regardless of whether I agree with her all the time it’s hard to say she doesnt have passion to make the US a better place.,-1,-1
11041,"I loved seeing this. She was spitting fire. Frankly, we need a hell of a lot more of this kind of approach to the lies and fascism of the Republican party.",-1,-1
11042,"I mean, no one will ever accuse republicans of being logical but it’s insulting that they pretend that there’s logic behind their actions. 

Like anyone with half a brain can see that the antisemitic party doesn’t care about condemning antisemitism but we’re supposed to believe that’s the case because they say so, despite dumbass Marg consistently rises in their ranks. Good on AOC for calling them out but since republican voters have less than half a brain, what’s clear to everyone else doesn’t really matter to them.",-1,-1
11043,"Who gives a shit they're not eligible to hold their positions legally after the insurrection. Idgaf about word duels we need fucking action against seditionists now! Sweeping action to deal with their existential threat.

Do your fucking jobs federal government.",-1,-1

11045,I don’t see how anyone thinks republicans are actually out to do good.,-1,-1

11047,"Jewish guy here, I can confirm we have space lasers aimed at the earth",-1,-1

11051,"To me, as a Jewish person, it’s clear that the Republican representatives don’t give a shit about anti-Semitism.",-1,-1
11052,"Damn, AOC, leave some snappy comebacks for the rest of us.",-1,-1
11053,"Has Ilhan Omar said anything about Judaism or Jews beyond the specific context of Israel? I think her outspokenness can sometimes be damaging to her political prospects, but is there even one thing she has said that is clearly antisemetic? Any of her critics care to explain?",-1,-1
11054,"She’s right. We need to get rid of all these racist politicians. There’s no room for racists in this country, such ideas fly in the face of what liberty and freedom stands for.",-1,-1

Its sounds insane, but calling it Jewish Space Lasers is just the tip of the iceberg.  There is a lot to unpack there and all of it is incredibly stupid.",-1,-1
11056,"Never forget or minimize the fact that when MTG brought up Jewish space lasers she was saying that there is a Jewish conspiracy TO ASSASSINATE SANTA CLAUS.  
I feel like not enough emphasis makes it past the first half of the statement.",-1,-1
11057,"They used to conflate criticism of Israel with hatred of Jews and call both anti-Semitism. Now they've taken the next step: criticism of Israel is called anti-Semitism, while hatred of Jews is not.",-1,-1
11058,She's not wrong.,-1,-1
11059,"Why cant all other Dems be as fired up like that, like ever",-1,-1
11060,"The GOP are pathetic, racist, hypocrites and bullshit artist.",-1,-1
11061,"I’ve been listening to this podcast by the BBC called Nuremberg. I studied the holocaust in depth in college in the 90’s but this has reading of transcripts from some of the trials, and it’s intense. It’s also deeply disturbing how similar some of the language being used by the Nazis is to the Republican Party in America these days.",-1,-1
11062,"Exactly. They just hate dems libs women of color and most of all people with strong moral
Comoass",-1,-1
11063,She's not wrong. Republicans are shameful.,-1,-1
11064,Didn't they basically have to force MTG to acknowledge that the holocaust happened?,-1,-1
11065,"Yep! 

I’ve seen so many people defend the Republican party’s handling of Greene

Like, holly shit. The Republican Party never punished her and barely ever spoke ill of her. The only time a few GOP members criticised her was when they also voted to protect her.

They support Greene. They are represented by Greene",-1,-1
11066,In case you were looking for proof that republicans don’t give a fuck about America.  <Rod Serling> Only in…The Twilight Zone.,-1,-1
11067,I’m wondering how their voters vote for them. I’m just waiting for the other ball to drop when they finally cut Social Security and blame it on Democrats…,-1,-1
11068,The Republican Party is turning into everything they tell their base they're fighting against. What a bunch of bitchy little hypocrites.,-1,-1
11069,Ocasio Cortez is correct. The gop don't care about antisemitism beyond promoting it.,-1,-1
11070,Republicans have been promising for years to remove Ilhan from the Foreign Affairs Committee since she first joined it. Because she is Muslim they actually  believe she is not loyal enough to America to sit in this important committee. this is purely anti Muslim action.,-1,-1
11071,Why should GOP condemn semitism? They're an openly fascist party.,-1,-1
11072,She screamed at the parents of mass shooting victims! That is on video. Wake up,-1,-1
11073,Republicans and a bad faith argument? I mean…that’s literally what the party is built on,-1,-1
11074,"AOC claps back better than most of them.    

Whatever side, she's got a good sense of what's going on and staffers that are on point.",-1,-1
11075,I want to see Republicans’ response to this 1-minute speech by AOC that was 10x more inspiring than anything Kevin McCarthy has said in his tenure.,-1,-1
11076,AOC and Omar both tell truth to power and power hates them for their honesty and integrity.,-1,-1
11077,"But is Omar really antisemitic? Yes she did make negative comments against the Israeli government and some of their terrible actions throughout the years.  But I think most of what she said is quite fair.  She condemned the actions of many groups and governments. 

I'm against a lot of the actions that the US , Canadian and other various governments have committed over their history, does not mean I hate the whole race. 

Could she have chosen her words more carefully, probably. 

But when you compare what she says in contrast to the right, I would say it is pretty mild. 

I think an important question to ask is, is she making a difference in her role? This is how everyone in government should be judged, but sadly we just look at the R our the D, the right vs the left and ignore all else.

Edit to clarify government",-1,-1
11078,"And they refuse to oust a member who masqueraded as a descendent of Holocaust victims. 

AOC spitting straight fire once again.",-1,-1
11079,"And AOC's ""antisemitism"" was criticizing Israel for their actions in Palestine",-1,-1
11080,They also can’t seem to understand being anti-Israeli apartheid is not the same as being anti-Semitic. But can’t expect them to realize that given they don’t educate themselves.,-1,-1
11081,Bro I fkn hate Republicans,-1,-1
11082,"It was 100% because Ilhan is a strong independent black woman.

That scares the life out of the GOP because they know she has more of a spine than they ever will.",-1,-1
11083,"The thing is that this wasn't about antisemitic comments.  That was just a convenient excuse to hide their obvious racism.

They felt it was incredibly irresponsible to have a Muslim on the foreign affairs committee, cuz you know, she's friends with Al Qaeda and ISIS just simply due to her religion and skin color.  They see it as 1+1=2 because they're a bunch of fucking idiots.",-1,-1
11084,"I bet they laughed at these comments because they know how riduclous they, Republicans, are. They don't even care. AOC can make all the noise she wants. Republicans are getting exactly what they want so they literally don't give a shit. It's sad really. As long as power and money flows in their direction they'll happily keep taking the hits.",-1,-1
11085,Didn’t MTG also said the holocaust was a hoax anyways? AOC isn’t wrong,-1,-1
11086,"I disagree with AOC on a lot of things,  but you can't deny her wit.  This is awesome.",-1,-1
11087,Obviously it’s bullshit. But to understand this logic you have to agree the GQP sees every issue as an isolated one. Patterns be ignored unless helpful to their opinions,-1,-1
11088,"Republicans are hypocrites.

In other news water is wet.",-1,-1
11089,Amen.,-1,-1
11090,They really have no moral high ground anymore. Even if it was just an illusion before. They let the crazies in and now they are in control.,-1,-1
11091,"I really don't get Jews who vote Republican at this point. 

How much do they have to court the Nazi and white supremacist vote before you realize low taxes and supporting Israel aren't enough?",-1,-1
11092,Clowns all the way downtown while the GOP circus is around.,-1,-1
11093,I don’t want her near anything Jewish. Was she their best pick? The ‘Jewish space laser’ lady?,-1,-1
11094,Same old trick. Minorities always get blame for country's i issues,-1,-1
11095,"To be fair to MTG, after she first started making all the antisemitic statements McConnell made her give a press conference to placate some of the donors. At the conference MTG let every one know she recently learned the Holocaust was real and she thought it was bad. So she's totally not a bigoted piece of shit anymore. /s",-1,-1
11096,"I appreciate her calling out the BS. But it's all the low hanging fruit BS. She's got a platform because the Republicans have given her one by hating her so much, she should be using it to point out the other shit as well, the stuff that isn't just surface ""we're morons"" stuff. For instance and just something topical - how the Republicans have increased the debt more than Dems then won't agree to increase the debt ceiling when they can and Dem holds the WH. Or how Trumps tax cuts were permanent for the corps but expired for normal people to get it through.  Idk, maybe she does and those posts just don't get as much coverage. That also makes me sad lol.",-1,-1
11097,GOP has spent the better part of the past decade refusing to condemn hate groups. They've no leg to stand on.,-1,-1
11098,"Other republicans need to start holding them accountable. If you want to vote Republican, fine, that’s your choice. Start standing up to your politicians who blatantly lie.",-1,-1
11099,"Did anyone notice how Business Insider and general media continues to label AOC and her colleagues as the “squad,” but no labeling of the insurrectionists at large because they are whites.",-1,-1
11100,But having a Jewish Space Laser system is pro-Israel! /s,-1,-1
11101,Nothing republicans do or say is in good faith. doesn't even matter if they're lying or not,-1,-1
11102,"When AOC and MTG face each other in the presidential election, we will know that the end is near.",-1,-1
11103,The only standards they have are double standards,-1,-1
11104,I don’t like AOC but she’s right,-1,-1
11105,"I honestly dont know how AOC and others can stand to even be around these sick loons anymore. They walk into our congress while armed, spew nazi tropes, and spend all their time devising ways to hurt Americans and others.",-1,-1
11106,"Her whole speech/rebuttal/whathaveye was fire. She blasted them. She said they allowed the guy who threatened her with physical violence to get put on a committee, which is sickeningly true.",-1,-1
11107,"great speech from
AOC",-1,-1
11108,"All of congress needs to be removed from office, not one of them is fit to fix this country a bunch of self serving idiots",-1,-1
11109,"AOC ain't wrong, regardless of what you otherwise think of her.",-1,-1
11110,"For a fun time, watch how the media has to tap dance around how batshit insane Republicans are?",-1,-1
11111,She ain't wrong,-1,-1
11112,AIPAC needs to quit supporting these loons,-1,-1
11113,"It's to bad ALL politicians can't get over their egos and actually work together to make the lives of Americans better and focus on the real issues. Our countries ""democracy"" is a joke.",-1,-1
11114,She’s crazy but did she really mention the Jews or is this a “I can see Russia from my house” thing?,-1,-1
11115,"
Why the pic in her mask? Her speech was without,",-1,-1
11116,I wonder if there are any Jewish voters that voted Republican.,-1,-1
11117,Well maybe do something about it then??,-1,-1
11118,This energy right here. It’s about time!,-1,-1
11119,Didn’t the “Jewish Space Lasers” play CBGB?,-1,-1
11120,Republicans “we denounce antisemitism but the Jews are responsible for all our problems”.,-1,-1
11121,"The QOP excuse will suffice, as people will now debate ""both sides,"" which is just straight up total...horseshit. pretty tired of listening to them talk",-1,-1
11122,I am not sure what a red wave in 2022 would have been like. This is still pretty bad.,-1,-1
11123,"AOC should have went with comparing vaccines to yellow stars, going with the billionaire space laser belief seems silly to those that don't pay attention to politics.",-1,-1
11124,"AOC is clever and correct, but misses the point that GOPers don’t care if you point out their hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is the new sacrament of the right.",-1,-1
11125,They don't call it a trailer park. ITS GLAMPING,-1,-1
11126,"The scariest part of this whole thing is that foreign country has effectively forbidden American citizens, who all enjoy constitutionally protected 1st amendment freedoms, from criticizing Israel irrespective of the reason. If it were China doing the same, people would be up in arms.",-1,-1
11127,It’s a shame that calling out hypocrisy will have no effort on this GOP. But it’s still worth doing! Never Yield!,-1,-1
11128,Perfect.,-1,-1
11129,I love AOC. She legit doesn’t give a fuck and calls them out on every single hypocrisy they spew.,-1,-1
11130,"Let’s be honest, AOC went in and was spot on.",-1,-1
11131,AOC is awesome.   She's so cool she's almost Canadian.,-1,-1
11132,"It's kinda wild how the GOP turned ""anti-Semitism"" from a phrase that mean 'anti-Jewish"" into one that means ""Doesn't blindly support the Israeli apartheid state.""",-1,-1
11133,"Dude!
This shit was savage!
I love AOC!
AOC for president!
Stick it to those racist assholes!",-1,-1
11134,"Without speaking to specifics, referring to any criticism of anyone who adheres to the Jewish religion or the Israeli state as antisemitism does a disservice to the overall effort to snuff out actual antisemitism in our society. Jewish people act erroneously and Israel does evil. Saying those things is not antisemitic.",-1,-1
11135,"As a Jew, can I politely point out that *both* Ilhan Omar and Margerie Taylor Greene have made a ton of antisemitic remarks?

I don't agree with removing Omar from her committee, and I'm a lifelong Democrat, but it does rub me the wrong way to have my people treated as pawns in all of this. Saying ""You guys are even more antisemitic,"" to the Republicans, while true, doesn't make me feel better about the fact that it's coming from both parties these days.",-1,-1
11136,And how is being critical of Israel being anti semitic? Israel has 100% done some horrible things. You can be unhappy with Israel and not hate Jewish people.,-1,-1
11137,It's the turban,-1,-1
11138,"May I ask, what Omar said exactly that was ""antisemitic""? I tried looking it up and alot of the articles from a few years back from when this supposedly happened seem to shy away from the exact quote.",-1,-1
11139,Most of these Republicans should be prosecuted at this point wtf is going on,-1,-1
11140,Republicans just want to be assholes…and they want it to be mandatory that everyone has to deal with them.,-1,-1

11143,AOC is amazing!,-1,-1
11144,I don’t care.  Stop corporations from buying houses,-1,-1
11145,This is what the right wingers did in the UK. They used anti-Semitism to bring down a prominent left wing leader - Jeremy Corbyn.,-1,-1
11146,I'm not taking advice from the party with a literal pedophile as their swing vote.,-1,-1
11147,Democrats never realize that GOP hypocrisy and crazy culture wars are theatrical strategy - a bait and switch tactic to rile their neck beard constituents while simultaneously grifting them.,-1,-1

Well, Taylor Greene’s post suggested that the Rothschild banking firm is behind a supposed corporate cabal that engineered this whole space laser plot. Ah, of course, the old Rothschild family explanation again. As Zack Beauchamp wrote for Vox, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about the Rothschild family controlling the world have frequently surfaced in the past. Beauchamp explained that this was not “an isolated anti-Semitic incident for Greene.” In fact, the Editorial Board for USA TODAY wrote that “her Facebook account contained racist, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic views,” which doesn’t sound very nice. Beauchamp stated that Taylor Greene’s “space laser” theory is “the latest in a long line of conspiracies about the Rothschild family, and those conspiracies are always, at root, anti-Semitic: Since the 19th century, people have used claims that this one particular wealthy family controls the world to cast aspersions on Jews in general.”",-1,-1

Conservatism - in all times and places - is the political movement to protect aristocracy (intergenerational wealth and political power) which we now call oligarchs, and enforce social hierarchy. This hierarchy involves a morality centered around social status such that the aristocrat is inherently moral (an extension of the divinely ordained king) and the lower working class is inherently immoral. The actions of a good person are good. The actions of a bad person are bad. The only bad action a good person can take is to interfere with the hierarchy. All conservative groups in all times and places are working to undo the French Revolution, democracy, and working class rights. 

Populist conservative voter groups are created and controlled with propaganda. They wish to subjugate their local peers and rank people and don’t see the feet of aristocrats kicking them too.

Another way, Conservatives - those who wish to maintain a class system - assign moral value to people and not actions. Those not in the aristocracy are immoral and therefore deserve punishment.

https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/conservatism.html

https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288 I like the concept of Conservatism vs. anything else.

*****
Most of my the examples are American, but conservatism is the same mission in all times and places. 

A Bush speech writer takes the assertion for granted: It's all about the upper class vs. democracy. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/06/why-do-democracies-fail/530949/ To paraphrase: “Democracy fails when the Elites are overly shorn of power.”

Read here: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservatism/ and here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism#History and see that all of the major thought leaders in Conservatism have always opposed one specific change (democracy at the expense of aristocratic power). At some point non-Conservative intellectuals and/or lying Conservatives tried to apply the arguments of conservatism to generalized “change.”

Philosophic understandings include criticism. The Stanford page (despite taking pains to justify generalized/small c/populist conservatism) includes criticisms. Involving those, we can conclude generalized conservatism (small c) is a myth at best and a Trojan Horse at worst.

*****
Incase you don’t want to read the David Frum piece here is a highlight that democracy only exists at the leisure of the elite represented by Conservatism. 

>The most crucial variable predicting the success of a democratic transition is the self-confidence of the incumbent elites. If they feel able to compete under democratic conditions, they will accept democracy. If they do not, they will not.
And the single thing that most accurately predicts elite self-confidence, as Ziblatt marshals powerful statistical and electoral evidence to argue, is the ability to build an effective, competitive conservative political party before the transition to democracy occurs.

Conservatism, manifest as a political effort is simply the effort of the Elites to maintain their privileged status. Why is it that specifically Conservative parties nearly always align with the interests of the Elite? 

*****

There is a key difference between conservatives and others that is often overlooked. For non-conservatives actions are good, bad, moral, etc and people are judged based on their actions. For Conservatives, people are good, bad, moral, etc and the status of the person is what dictates how an action is viewed.

In the world view of the actual Conservative leadership - those with true wealth or political power - , the aristocracy is moral by definition and the working class is immoral by definition and deserving of punishment for that immorality. This is where the laws don't apply trope comes from or all you’ll often see “rules for thee and not for me.” The aristocracy doesn't need laws since they are inherently moral. Consider the divinely ordained king: he can do no wrong because he is king, because he is king at God’s behest. The anti-poor aristocratic elite still feel that way. 

This is also why people can be wealthy and looked down on: if Bill Gates tries to help the poor or improve worker rights too much he is working against the aristocracy and hierarchy.  

*****

If we extend analysis to the voter base: conservative voters view other conservative voters as moral and good by the state of being labeled conservative because they adhere to status morality and social classes. It's the ultimate virtue signaling. They signal to each other that they are inherently moral. It’s why voter base conservatives think “so what” whenever any of these assholes do nasty anti democratic things. It’s why Christians seem to ignore Christ. 

While a non-conservative would see a fair or moral or immoral action and judge the person undertaking the action, a conservative sees a fair or good person and applies the fair status to the action. To the conservative, a conservative who did something illegal or something that would be bad on the part of someone else - must have been doing good. Simply because they can’t do bad.

To them Donald Trump is inherently a good person as a member of the aristocracy. The conservative isn’t lying or being a hypocrite or even being ""unfair"" because - and this is key - for conservatives past actions have no bearing on current actions and current actions have no bearing on future actions so long as the aristocracy is being protected. Lindsey Graham is ""good"" so he says to delay SCOTUS confirmations that is good. When he says to move forward: that is good.

To reiterate: All that matters to conservatives is the intrinsic moral state of the actor (and the intrinsic moral state that matters is being part of the aristocracy). Obama was intrinsically immoral and therefore any action on his part was “bad.” Going further - Trump, or the media rebranding we call Mitt Romney, or Moscow Mitch are all intrinsically moral and therefore they can’t do “bad” things. The one bad thing they can do is betray the class system. 


*****

The consequences of the central goal of conservatism and the corresponding actor state morality are the simple political goals to do nothing when large social problems arise and to dismantle labor & consumer protections. The non-aristocratic are immoral, inherently deserve punishment, and certainly don’t deserve help. They *want* the working class to get fucked by global warming. They *want* people to die from COVID19. Etc. 

Montage of McConnell laughing at suffering: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTqMGDocbVM&ab_channel=HuffPost

Months after I first wrote this it turns out to be validated by conservatives themselves: https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/16/trump-appointee-demanded-herd-immunity-strategy-446408

Why do the conservative voters seem to vote against their own interest? Why does /selfawarewolves and /leopardsatemyface happen? They simply think they are higher on the social ladder than they really are and want to punish those below them for the immorality. 

Absolutely everything Conservatives say and do makes sense when applying the above. This is powerful because you can now predict what a conservative political actor will do. 


*****


More familiar definitions of general/populist/small-c conservatism are a weird mash-up including personal responsibility and incremental change. Neither of those makes sense applied to policy issues. The only opposed change that really matters is the destruction of the aristocracy in favor of democracy. For some reason the arguments were white washed into a general “opposition to change.” 

https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/democratic-administrations-historically-outperform-on-economy-by-j-bradford-delong-2020-10


 * This year a few women can vote, next year a few more, until in 100 years all women can vote?


 * This year a few kids can stop working in mines, next year a few more...


 * We should test the waters of COVID relief by sending a 1200 dollar check to 500 families. If that goes well we’ll do 1500 families next month.


 * But it’s all in when they want to separate migrant families to punish them. It’s all in when they want to invade the Middle East for literal generations. 

The incremental change argument is asinine. It’s propaganda to avoid concessions to labor. 

The personal responsibility argument falls apart with the ""keep government out of my medicare thing."" Personal responsibility just means “I deserve free things, but people of lower in the hierarchy don’t.”

Personal liberty just means the aristocrat won’t be held responsible. The actual practice of conservatism has always serves to enforce class structure and that’s been constant since it was first written about.

A nice quote:

>The policies of the Republicans in power have been exclusively economic, but the coalition has caused the social conservatives to be worse off economically, due to these pro-corporate policies. Meanwhile, the social issues that the ""Cons"" faction pushes never go anywhere after the election. According to Frank, ""abortion is never outlawed, school prayer never returns, the culture industry is never forced to clean up its act."" He attributes this partly to conservatives ""waging cultural battles where victory is impossible,"" such as a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. He also argues that the very capitalist system the economic conservatives strive to strengthen and deregulate promotes and commercially markets the perceived assault on traditional values.

And my response: 

Conservatism is the party that represents the aristocracy. The Republican Party has been the American manifestation of that. They’ve courted uneducated, bigots, and xenophobes as their voter base. Their voter base is waking up to things and overpowering the aristocrats in the party. Which leaves us with a populist party whose drivers are purely bigotry and xenophobia. For some bizarre reason they latched onto Aristocrat Trump, mistaking his lack of manners (which is the only thing typical conservatives don’t like about him) for his not being a member of the elite.

*****

The political terms Left and Right were first used in the 18th century, during the French Revolution, in reference to the seating arrangement of the French parliament. Those who sat to the right of the chair of the presiding officer (le président) were generally supportive of the institutions of the monarchist Old Regime.[20][21][22][23] The original ""Right"" in France was formed in reaction to the ""Left"" and comprised those supporting hierarchy, tradition, and clericalism.[4]:693 The expression la droite (""the right"") increased in use after the restoration of the monarchy in 1815, when it was applied to the Ultra-royalists.[24]

Right-wing politics embraces the view that certain social orders and hierarchies are inevitable, natural, normal, or desirable,[1][2][3] typically supporting this position on the basis of natural law, economics, or tradition.[4]:693, 721[5][6][7][8][9] Hierarchy and inequality may be seen as natural results of traditional social differences[10][11] or competition in market economies.[12][13][14] The term right-wing can generally refer to ""the conservative or reactionary section of a political party or system"".[15]

According to The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought, the Right has gone through five distinct historical stages:[19]
1. The reactionary right sought a return to aristocracy and established religion.
2. The moderate right distrusted intellectuals and sought limited government.
3. The radical right favored a romantic and aggressive form of nationalism.
4. The extreme right proposed anti-immigration policies and implicit racism.
5. The neo-liberal right sought to combine a market economy and economic deregulation with the traditional right-wing beliefs in patriotism, elitism and law and order.[9][page needed]

In Great Britain, the Tory movement during the Restoration period (1660–1688) was a precursor to conservatism. Toryism supported a hierarchical society with a monarch who ruled by divine right. However, Tories differ from conservatives in that they opposed the idea that sovereignty derived from the people and rejected the authority of parliament and freedom of religion. Robert Filmer's Patriarcha: or the Natural Power of Kings (published posthumously in 1680, but written before the English Civil War of 1642–1651) became accepted as the statement of their doctrine.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism scroll down to Burke.

*****

So this article posits that ""Burke, conservatism’s “master intellectual”, acknowledged by almost all subsequent conservatives."" "" was a lifelong student of the Enlightenment who saw in the French Revolution the ultimate threat to…modern, rational, libertarian, enlightened Whig values.”

We're also told ""Burke was “less concerned with protecting the individual from the potential tyranny of the State, and more to protect the property of the few from the folly and rapacity of the many”""

The Plato page gives the abstract ""With the Enlightenment, the natural order or social hierarchy, previously largely accepted, was questioned."" And it also gives various versions of conservatism being pragmatic and not very theoretical or philosophical. Well what was the natural order, the few, and the social hierarchy, and traditional institutions, and traditions *to Burke* and to other conservative forefathers?

We also get the interesting tidbit ""Conservatives reject the liberal’s concept of abstract, ahistorical and universal rights, derived from the nature of human agency and autonomy, and possessed even when unrecognised..."" which undergirds the idea that *not everyone has or inherently deserves the same rights.* [I will editorialize here and argue that that conservative tenet is inherently at odds with the contemporary democracy of the developed world and our ideas of ""human rights."" It also falls right in line with my post discussing person vs. action based morality.]

We also find that upon reading Burke ""German conservatives adopted positions from reformism to reaction, **aiming to contain democratic forces**—though not all of them were opposed to the Aufklärung or Enlightenment. 

""Benjamin Disraeli (1804–81), founder of the essentially Burkean “One Nation” conservatism, was a politician first, writer and thinker second. Disraeli never actually used the phrase “One Nation”, but it was implied. The term comes from his 1845 novel Sybil; or the two nations, where Walter Gerard, a working-class radical, describes “Two nations; between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy; who are as ignorant of each other’s habits, thoughts and feelings, as if they were dwellers in different zones, or inhabitants of different planets…The RICH and the POOR”. His aim was to unite these two nations through the benevolent leadership of the Conservative Party.""

And ""To reiterate, reaction is not Burkean conservatism, however. De Maistre (1753–1821) was a reactionary critic of reason, intellectuals and **universal rights.** Burke attacked the revolutionaries of 1789 “for the sake of traditional liberties, [Maistre] for the sake of **traditional authority**” (Viereck 2009: 191). 

Interestingly we also find ""According to Hegel, Rousseau’s contractual account destroys the “divine” element of the state (ibid.)."" This is clearly referring the idea that monarchies and surrounding wealthy people are divinely ordained to hold such power and wealth.

To reject the Enlightenment *as discussed* and to appeal to natural order, the few, and the social hierarchy, and traditional institutions, and traditions is to defend the ""landed nobility, monarchy and established church."" Even if not explicitly stated, those things are the spine of conservatism **as acted out**. The Plato page discussion of criticisms does a nice job refuting the incremental change aspects and so I won't repeat them.

If you push past the gluttony of abstraction and also read more primary Burke, et all. it is very clear that the traditional institution and authority being defended is the landed nobility. And that is still the unchanging goal.",-1,-1

11322,"I think you are *mostly* correct, but I think there's a critical misunderstanding here:

> To the conservative, a conservative who did something illegal or something that would be bad on the part of someone else - must have been doing good. Simply because they can’t do bad.

I've observed that it's a bit more complex than this. It's not so much that conservatives think all other conservatives must be doing good - it's that they think only conservatives have the capacity to do good at all. The reason they think laws shouldn't apply to them isn't because they think their actions are automatically moral but because they don't think they deserve the same punishments as others, because they understand what they did wrong and won't do it again - and if they do do it again, well, they won't do it again next time, or the time after that... 

Conservatives have a strong sense of objective right and wrong. They understand that it's ""bad"" to get an abortion, but it's okay for a conservative woman to get one, because she understands it's bad and therefore can be trusted to not do it unless it's really necessary, which basically isn't even an abortion anyway right? They understand that it's bad when Trump cheats on his wife, it's just that Trump is a conservative, which means that he must have just made a mistake and is definitely really sorry so there's no need to judge him or ask for any accountability.

But let me remind you of 2019 when Omar said, in the context of the US-Israel relationship: “I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.” Rep. Omar, in response to a tweet from House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, wrote: “I should not be expected to have allegiance/pledge support to a foreign country in order to serve my country in Congress or serve on committee.”

Rep. Omar has argued that these statements reflect good faith disagreements about US policy toward Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and the relationship between the two. This could not be further from the truth.

Accusing Jews of having allegiance to a foreign government has long been a vile anti-Semitic slur that has been used to harass, marginalize, and persecute the Jewish people for centuries. Sometimes referred to as the “dual loyalty” charge, it alleges that Jews should be suspected of being disloyal neighbors or citizens because their true allegiance is to their co-religionists around the world or to a secret and immoral Jewish agenda.

Under this agreement German Jews, who had their assets frozen in Germany, were allowed to immigrate to Palestine and transfer their frozen assets there under the condition that those assets be used to purchase German products. From the perspective of the German government, this was a double win because it meant both removing Jews from Germany and increasing German exports abroad.

Its important to explain the specifics on how hypnotized can be tied to anti-semitism isn’t related to *literal* hypnotism.

One word of his overlapped with Omar’s, and in her instance she’s referencing Israel’s government. 

He isn’t referring to literal hypnotism, so there’s no deeper meaning to tie it to some of the ridiculous borderline supernatural conspiracy theories about blood drinking which is what eventually evolved into adrenochrome conspiracies. I debunk and trace the history of conspiracies as a hobby, I’ve got a decent idea of what these freaks believe. Adrenochrome, or it’s progenitor practice that lead to a blood drinking conspiracy by outsiders, the old practice of Metzitzah B’peh, is essentially the origin of modern day adrenochrome conspiracies. Using the word hypnotic doesn’t refer to any type of actual hypnosis, there’s no deep conspiracy there. 

Also no shit both parties denounced her, Democrats have been backing Israel and their apartheid state for a long time. Being for the equal treatment of Palestinians has never been a massive notion in either party.

I called out the Trump campaign for its thinly disguised anti-Semitic TV ad in 2016 running photos of George Soros, Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein and saying, ‘The Establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election.  For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interests, they partner with these people who don’t have your good in mind.’

Article 4, section 4, clause 1:

> Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.

15th Amendment, sections 1 and 2:

It is really not that hard to just look this shit up. The US constitution is not a long document. Congress and the federal agencies empowered by it have an absolute right to change and enforce election laws and rules that pertain to federal elections except as to who gets to choose Senators (that is why the 17th amendment was needed for that).",-1,-1

11651,"There are many toxic behaviours now intimately associated with the modern Republican Party — the often outrageous lies, the coverups and self-justification (especially of Trump's behaviour), the focus on hurting opponents, the nurturing of conspiracies, and the fomenting of violence. Is there a central cause to these? Some suggest they are natural result of a psychological type which is attracted to the party(e.g. the [""paranoid style""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paranoid_Style_in_American_Politics) or right wing authoritarianism) and thus perhaps inescapable. Others suggest the party is stuck in a toxic feedback loop that's nigh inescapable. Others seem to hold a theory that Republican behaviour is primarily strategy, albeit unethical, dictated by present circumstances (cf. if you can't win elections, reject democracy). 

So two questions: 

- What is your personal thesis around what motivates the behavioural pathology of the Republican Party? And, given your thesis:
- What, if anything, do you think it would take to make the Republican Party (apparatus, volunteer base, & elected officials) genuinely repent or seek to detox treatment?",-1,-1

How many of the GOP officials, in our experience, actually believe that here is ""socialism"" everywhere, and as a followup how many would you say would absolutely be behind another coup or overthrow if they lose the White House next year?

Would the current GOP, again in your experience working with them, start advocating for the ""other-izing"" of those of us with disabilities and other psychologies if it provided a scapegoat to attack? (I have been diagnosed with high functioning autism and have some experience with online right-wingers using in their comment fallacy games, and in-person times where I've thins about my appearance gave them something to hurt, like I am male and I have long hair because haircuts other me, so one guy once told me that I'd be sexually assaulted by 'South Central bangers"")

The politics of this day and age are so extreme that I truly feel like conservatives and liberals are socially and culturally incompatible with each other, and the nation will somehow, someway, fracture as a result. They hate us, and we hate them. There is no room for compromise when it comes to human rights, and many in the GOP thrive on the suffering of those they see as lesser. Our younger generations are more depressed and angry than ever before because they see the world they are about to inherit and how powerless they are against corporate interests and increasingly pervasive socially regressive rhetoric on the right. Our founding document is old and out of touch with modern society, and changing it meaningfully is damn near impossible, and the only ones making a real effort to get a new constitutional convention together are the Republicans, who could only be doing so for nefarious, self-serving ideological purposes. Police continue to kill with near impunity, to the point the general consensus among Americans 30 and younger is that all cops are bad until something is done about the system itself. Government and corporate power are so entrenched now that peaceful protest doesn't work anymore because they know they can just wait it out. In short, I do not see a path forward for this country. Some days I feel like we're better off burning it all down and starting over from scratch, but that not only is not guaranteed to succeed and could very well backfire, but either way it would involve huge loss of life.

My personal preference would've been to unpack the Supreme Court (and lower courts: more circuits, and more seats at both the trial and appellate levels) while there was a Democratic trifecta. Get a liberal majority on the Supreme Court, who can then put an end to gerrymandering, dark money, actual and constructive voter disenfranchisement, shut down ISLT before it's allowed to take root, etc.

But, obviously, that ship has sailed. Where do you see things heading? Any blind spots you think Democrats are missing? What's the way out with a captured judiciary that's unconstrained and a captured party in Congress unwilling to impose any constraints on the judiciary?

Unrelated, but if you're up to it: what do you think should/will be the resolution of the pending debt limit showdown? Will the GOP crash the US/global economies to extract concessions? Will they blink? Assuming they're on a kamikaze mission, what's your preferred resolution? Trillion dollar coin(s)? Arguing the 14th Amendment takes precedence over the statutory debt limit and continuing to service the debt anyway? Letting the GOP get its way and owning the fallout?

If I were to pinpoint one area that pushed me over the edge, and into deep introspection, it would be the Hollywood Access Tape. He was on tape bragging about sexual assault.   
  
What really made it sink in was the fact that the RNC floor I was working on had 30ish TV playing MSNBC, and CNN all day. And the Clinton campaign would play that Hollywood Access tape in ads continuously – it felt like every 30 seconds. So I had to confront that I was working 80-100 hours a week to elect Trump and the GOP with facing this absolutely disgusting fact many times a day.

Why did I work for the GOP?

I thought that I could impact the GOP from the inside out and held economic views on trade, the military and America's standing in the world that were similar to the establishment GOP in 2014.

I went into working for a Tea Pary guy as a policy advisor and shifted his policy significantly toward the center ... He was the 218th vote on Obama's largest second-term agenda item, Trade promotion Authority. While he still said stupid shit, I also toned down his rhetoric.

Podcast is center left because of the perspective I bring, the guests we host and the topics we cover. I am very socially liberal. The things I describe are largely the things I think people would be interested in hearing in a reddit ama.

I was also a DEMOCRAT political appointee for the Governor of Puerto Rico and managed a $90 billion appropriations request to rebuild that island. And I pushed for statehood. I just doubt people are interested in this or how legislation gets passed.

The GOP is more focused on winning over the “working class” voters with their rhetoric on manufacturing, climate change and calling Dems socialist. So while they will continue to lose the youth vote, there view is that they can flip voters as they get older – especially folks with blue collar jobs.   
  
This analysis is OVERLY broad. Elections are won and lost off a percentage point here or there. They are also district and state specific. So there are a bunch of strategies in play. Like increasing the share of Hispanic vote, etc.",-1,-1

My thesis is that its a combination of a feedback loop that you mention from the media, and their grassroots activists, the impact of money in politics (both koch brothers style and MTG small donors), and a lot of the base voters and extreme right-wing politicians having a siege mentality. Two podcast episodes we discuss this in I point you to.

There are major disagreements on when we can start tracking the current iteration of the GOP right-wing. I believe that to be 2008 financial crisis and the Koch Brothers setting up their Tea Party grassroots network. That's where I think the modern day cutoff should begin. 

Solution? Massive electoral losses so that these politicians learn that elevating culture wars, and extreme rhetoric painting Democrats as your enemy will not win nationally. Only when rock bottom has been hit can the establishment attempt to regain influence. But even then, its really difficult with gerrymandering.",-1,-1
11697,"Ok, so there is a lot here. [Here’s an episode of our podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/will-donald-trump-be-the-2024-republican-nominee/id1585080352?i=1000586558567) that somewhat answers this question while I argue why he will be the 2024 nominee.   
  
The short answer on Trump’s rise   
  
1.	National celebrity   
2.	Media elevation  
3.	It was the cycle of the outsider, aka people weren’t too keen on career politicians   
4.	Trump had an acerbic demeanor, which is what the Tea Party voters and activists LOVED.  
5.	Trump’s policies, protectionist, xenophobic, etc were aligned with the Tea Party   
6.	In primaries, the grassroots activists have a lot of sway in specific states, so he quickly carved out a sizeable base   
  
He changed the party by further elevating the Tea Party and their ideas, which had been relatively a fringe movement of extremists.   
  
Regarding how politicians viewed Trump when he was running vs after he won. Many of them largely thought Trump was a vile buffoon. They initially came out against him. When he became President, these criticisms moved to behind closed doors and they viewed him as a vessel to accomplish their policy priorities, or to manipulate into career advancement.",-1,-1
11698,"Well, this is really broad. Can we dig into this a bit more? 

Older generation as in elected officials in the 90s and the oughts? Or older currently elected officials?",-1,-1
11699,"It is a massive red flag for them.

I think its important to note that demographic trends in politics don't always go in a straight line, if they did, Texas would be blue. I know you did not say this, but I think its important to note.

In short, the GOP is paralyzed. So they are doing nothing. The GOP elites want to move past Trump to DeSantis, but I don't think this is likely in 2024.

In addition to Trump still having an outsized impact. The House Freedom Caucus now, for all practical purposes, controls the House. So they will be driving national coverage of legislation over the next 2 years which is a major problem for the GOP. 

Add in the [right-wing media ecosystem](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/is-right-wing-media-poisoning-the-gop-with-matt-k/id1585080352?i=1000596254313), and the party is stuck. 

They are in a very difficult position of their own making and I only see a resounding defeat being able to shift their approach to politics moving forward.",-1,-1
11700,"I don't.

Trump has a core following that will be difficult for anyone to overcome in a primary.

DeSantis is also a weird guy that lacks charisma. He's only been having interviews with friendly media and giving speeches. Very closely controlled public appearances. 

According to Florida reporters and politicos, I've spoken with, DeSantis also is somewhat paranoid and largely only trusts his wife as a political advisor. 

I think Trump attacks him and destroys him on the debate stage, IF DeSantis runs.

11701,"This is a great question. The Congressman I worked for was from the Kansas 1st. So I spent a lot of time with these voters. 

Short answer is that there is a lot of groupthink out there because its an overwhelmingly conservative area. To go a bit deeper, the GOP does a really great job of painting the entire Democratic party as in-line with the most unpopular Members of the party -- think AOC and Rep. Omar. Finally, the rightwing media ecosystem really distorts perceptions. If you listen to Hannity and the Erick Erickson types all day, you are going to have a siege mentality and hate the Democrats.  

Here is the thing. When you discuss policy with these folks, there is a lot of common ground. Most don't want the police armed to the teeth, most don't want the cops murdering black men. 

However, the branding by the GOP of socialism, and the elevation of the more unpopular Members of the Dem party creates a strong aversion to most Democrats.",-1,-1

As someone who ""attempts"" to understand opposing viewpoints, I tend to discard the most extreme on either spectrum, but I think we can all agree that one ideology has made it their platform to simply deceive their voter base. And as I am typing this, I question if it really is deception, if they're simply openly stating what their base quietly thinks but is too cowardly to admit to people around them, because even in their own mind, it's a shameful stance toward community and fellow citizens?

11738,"> I think that we are being overly broad here as the GOP isn't just one faction. 

Well, there are some theories that try to be broad, and others such as yours, which tend to break down the system into components that interact in a particular way. I was just trying to give a few examples to frame the question. But personally I tend to agree with the influence of several components you ID, including ""the impact of money in politics"". 

One component you've left out — perhaps for good reason, or perhaps you just identify it differently — might be the apparent merger of the Trump faction and conspiracy theorists. IMO that's played an important role in the entrenchment of their ""painting Democrats as your enemy"", because now to them, dems are ""lizard people"" or a ""secret cabal"". Before Trump's tenure, I'd found a more equitable distribution of conspiracy believers on the left-right axis. But now, or since about 2016, it seems that, they have polarized. I'd point to the foundational roles of troll-farms, Q, 4chan, and certain Reddit communities in birthing what is now a loosely unified conspiracy movement with its own political figure at the centre. 

Looking back, in US elections I've observed prior to 2016, there's never been such a central and reoccurring role for conspiracy theories or ideologies. They seem to be a ""grassroots movement"" but without the standard corporate institutional backing (or AstroTurfing aspects) that you'd find with the [Tea Party movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement). 

**So, do you see a role of the conspiracy element, or is that just part of the ""siege mentality"" which you cite? Is it different from the Tea Party network or more of the same?**

I haven't listened to your podcast before, but I'll add those two episodes to the queue. 

> learn that elevating culture wars, and extreme rhetoric painting Democrats as your enemy will not win nationally

Curiously, many on the right use what seems to be a thought terminating cliché in answer to that: Candidate X lost ""because he wasn't Trumpy enough!"" I fear ideas like that might prevent learning. 

I'd also question whether there can really be an ability to ""learn"" if and when one's core support comes primarily from those with deeply counterfactual belief systems. Those who confront the beliefs are at risk of being primaried and exchanged for a worse option.

> Only when rock bottom has been hit can the establishment attempt to regain influence. But even then, its really difficult with gerrymandering.

Another system that I fear might parallel this is viruses in the natural environment. Many viruses circulate in Species A until that species builds up immunity, at which point the virus gets wiped out by lack of hosts. However that virus often has [another host, Species B, which acts as a reservoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_reservoir), from which it will eventually re-emerge to begin infecting Species A anew. 

Gerrymandered districts, or even ""red states"" likely tend to act as reservoirs. Gerrymandering itself might not be enough to achieve truly ""massive electoral losses"" unless first past the post is also eliminated.

11743,"Well, I thank you for your response. But, there are some issues with it that help illustrate the intent behind my questions. 

Criminal justice reform is a nice buzzword phrase, what actual reforms can you name that you support?

I never knew that stricter gun control (again, nice buzzword phrase with no actual policy stance behind it to explain what that buzzword is supposed to mean) and supporting living wages or conditions that might almost be...livable (unless you live in say, Flint MI or Jackson MS) were equality or dignity issues. Perhaps you could have mentioned how you feel about the rise of drag legislation or trans rights issues or what you are doing (or support) to protect communities who find themselves literally under fire, by people you helped influence with the GOP's constant promotion of 'guns everywhere' and 'trans = evil' philosophies?

You almost made a legitimate policy stance with the environment. Yet, you somehow completely managed to state any actual definable approaches other than ""i'm ok with what the other guys already did"", even after dealing with an immense natural disaster...

""Supporting institutions"" isn't really a common democratic standard talking point, its just being a decent human who understands what it means to be living in a functional society. Odd phrasing considering how your former party puts such a high priority on emphasizing the importance of 'supporting institutions' like the police or the military, and being the party of the constitution. Maybe update your talking points?

Thanks for the statement that party switchers with no policies are grifters looking for a spotlight, along with all your in depth policy comments (as covered above).

This exchange is exactly why I tell everyone to be suspicious of anyone claiming they are now a democrat when they were formerly not, especially when these people are/were in public positions.

1. Criminal justice reform — for starters would be to eliminate mandatory minimums. Second, remove qualified immunity for police officers. Third legalize MJ and immediately let folks out of prison for non-violent MJ crimes. 

2. I totally oppose anti-trans legislation. And think politicians demonizing the community are trash. 

3. Gun control — I believe Heller is an abomination of a decision, and that we need strict red-flag laws where states not implementing them lose federal funding. I also believe in banning assault weapons and the such. I think there should be a mandatory licensing program, like we have for cars. I also believe that gun makers should be liable. 

4. Expanding the public option is a pretty damn straight forward policy response.

5. Immigration — support a pathway to citizenship for people here that have no violent criminal record. Also support increasing number of legal immigrants per year, and streamlining the process to reduce wait times. I fully support expanding the H1b and H2a visa programs. 

6. I support positive economic incentives for transitioning our economy over to green energy. So that’s subsidies to increase manufacturing of related products and adoption of technologies. I support multilateral agreements to advance climate change, like the Paris accords. It’s important to promote a smooth transition regarding our production, and I believe that is done through making renewables more affordable. I also believe small businesses, homes, etc, should get some type of tax credits for switching to renewable. I’m pro-nuclear, and understand that this is contentious.

I feel like its the opposite and we're already getting a glimpse of it.  The tRump candidates went down in flames but all these ""moderate"" Republicans actually did quite well.  Yet what happened as soon as the ""moderates"" were sworn in?  They fall right in line with the the worst Republicans because they have no spine.

>Even after a public outcry, Gosar appeared at the same conference a year later, this time in a pre-recorded video. (He subsequently said the appearance was due to a miscommunication.)

11920,"I know you mean well, but the whole ""Apartheid state"" thing is part of the problem. It erases the actual problem (policies of the Israeli government that harm Palestinians) and replaces it with a national *identity*. Criticizing Israel's policies acknowledges that they can and should be changed. But if Israel is an Apartheid state, it cannot change while remaining Israeli; that's simply what it *is*. In other words, you have no recourse but to destroy the state. Which, oddly, also mirrors what the Israeli far-right claims (that they can't make the reforms necessary to ensure the Palestinians' peace and security because it would constitute national suicide) AND what Hamas claims (that they will not accept any outcome other than Israel's total destruction). It also erases the possibility of a two-state solution, wherein Palestinians have a state that is uniquely theirs, because in the Apartheid analogy, Apartheid was dismantled by creating a unitary south African state. But the historical context there was completely different (I could list the reasons but this is getting long-winded already); suffice it to say that it's a very round peg in a very square hole.

We had a Prime Minister (Tony Abbott) back in 2015 who was anti-gay marriage, *despite having an openly lesbian sister*, and his adult daughter publicly spoke out against his views. This was the same guy who ate the raw onion (skin still on!!!) and got called a misogynist by a female PM, you may have heard of him.

We had a full on white supremacist (Fraser Anning, who was an apologist for the 2019 Christchurch shooter) get elected, but it was only due to a weird technicality, and he lost his seat a couple years later. Interestingly, he was descended from station owners (ranchers) who massacred Aboriginals.

This year, we are going to have a referendum on a constitutional amendment.

The amendment would guarantee that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders can choose non-voting representatives that could speak in Parliament on Indigenous issues, especially when the government is going to make a law or policy specifically targeted at them.

The process to get to this, was roughly bipartisan with a bit of feet-dragging on the conservative side but more or less bipartisan.

But lately a lot of racists have come out of the woodwork, as the referendum has drawn closer.

IMO there is more casual racism in Australia than there is in the USA, but the USA has more extreme racists.

--------------

Just yesterday, there was a funeral for Cardinal George Pell.

He was the 3rd highest ranking Catholic in the world, and he spent decades of his life covering up child abuse by priests under his authority. He bribed and threatened victims and their families into silence, while moving the rapist priests to different parishes, so they could continue to abuse kids. People like him are the reason we had to make it illegal to not report child abuse.

He famously said that abortion was a worse moral failing than priests abusing children (he also said climate change was false, and refused to serve communion to LGBT people).

Tony Abbott, John Howard (conservative PM from 1996-2007) were both there along with the current leader of the Opposition (Peter Dutton, leader of the Liberal Party ... who are actually conservatives) and other well-known right wing Aussies.

At least Abbott and Howard actually knew the deceased. But Dutton barely knew him and was just going along to virtue signal to conservatives.",-1,-1

12006,"It is because conservatism (from ***any*** country) has 1 and only 1 true ideal: the preservation of an aristocracy. A major component of this leads to a very different view of morality.

For people who are liberal or left-leaning, it is ***actions*** that deem whether someone is moral. If someone lies constantly, or is hypocritical or, worse, is a sex offender or fraudster etc. A Liberal or left-wing person would view that person as having done something bad. If they continue to do this, they will be considered a bad person - as they keep doing bad things. 

Conversely, for people who are conservative, it is ***people*** that deem whether actions are moral. If someone is a good person, then what they do is also good. This is how Trump can lie and steal and not be considered bad, or Gaetz can be a sex offender and not be considered bad, or Santos can be a fraudster and not be considered bad... these people are Republicans and, therefore, are deemed ""good people"". So, what they do *must* be good. If anyone says any different, it is because they are fools, or liars themselves, or because they want to undermine good people to help bad people (where democrats are considered 'bad'). This stems from the Divine Right theory of monarchs and conservatism is purely a continuation of Divine Right, albeit cloaked in other verbiage. 

This is why, according to conservatives, simply being LGBT (which, in their mind, is equivalent to being a bad person) is enough by itself to lead to accusations of grooming or other heinous crimes. But, if they have actual Republican politicians who have been very, very credibly accused of being groomers/sex pests (e.g., Roy Moore)... that doesn't matter.

He didnt steal the information, it was already in his head.  He didnt misplace it, he knew what he was saying was classified.  It wasnt locked away safe.  It made it's way into adversarial possession when he blurted it out.

His excuse was as president, he can declassify anything he wants.

Yes, the President of the United States has broad authority to declassify certain kinds of information.

The OP specifically asked why Trump got a pass when he divulged classified information to Russian diplomats.

He told them information that he had gleaned from classified documents. 

Again, this is allowed and not the same as the issues he is facing now in mishandling the classified documents.",-1,-1

12274,">These balloons can scan more territory than a satellite because of its low speed. It is a violation of international law and an invasion of US airspace. 

Can you show me how this is a violation of int'l law - under what treaty? It's up several tens of thousands of feet higher in the sky than even spy craft typically fly, and there's no int'l law regarding how high up a country owns the sky. If this is illegal then so are commercial satellites and meteorological tools that are used every day globally. 

Sending a drone would've been both harder to trace and easier to direct, and would have had a much lower altitude. The balloon is basically a low orbit satellite itself so you can't argue oh its so much closer than spy satellites either. Elon Musk is flying thousands of low orbit surveillance-capable satellites over China right now so that people can get WiFi and I don't see them whining about it. For that matter, the Chinese government can just send a Chinese citizen to Montana to probe around if they want to - which they have been caught doing several times, with no real consequences, so why would they change their tactic up to be more complicated, draw more attention, and be less effective? A balloon is impossible to direct even under the best circumstances when it's 10-20 miles in the sky.",-1,-1

The reason they won't pop the balloon is once they do, they'll have to admit it's just a university research project or a civilian meteorologist's property.

They aren't though. A prototype isn't even designed yet. It's just words on paper, which isn't real development.

If you know anything about the US military, this project will likely get scrapped before it makes it to a prototype. They come up with thousands of ideas a year, and *maybe* go on to actually develop a couple dozen of the bigger ideas. Because oftentimes once you actually test a hypothesis and build a prototype, it's realized that a ground breaking idea is actually a broken idea.

Second, when a Democrat is in the White House, scream about the national debt as loudly and frantically as possible, freaking out about how “our children will have to pay for it!” and “we have to cut spending to solve the crisis!” This will force the Democrats in power to cut their own social safety net programs, thus shooting their welfare-of-the-American-people Santa Claus.’

12373,"That’s the Feds words. If the jobs market stays hot the way he intends to fix it is : 

In a blunt speech last Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the central bank's battle against inflation won't come without some casualties.

The Fed is firmly resolved to bring down inflation and to ""keep at it until the job is done,"" Powell said. But that plan — which involves a series of hefty interest rate hikes — will bring ""some pain to households and businesses,"" he acknowledged.

""What [Powell] calls 'some pain,' means putting people out of work, shutting down small businesses because the cost of money goes up, because the interest rates go up.""

Assuming there's no change in the labor force participation rate, every 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate translates to a loss of around 1.6 million jobs, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. So if the United States suffers a typical recession, where joblessness hovers at around 6%, that would amount to about 5 million jobs, he said.

Even if the Fed were to revise its inflation target from 2% to 3%, it would still need to slow the economy to the point where roughly 1.7 million jobs are lost, according to an analysis from RSM released Monday. That would translate to the unemployment rate rising from today's 3.5% to 4.6%.

""That is about as close as one may get to what can charitably be called a soft landing,"" RSM economists Joe Brusuelas and Tuan Nguyen wrote in the report. However, ""while a soft landing would be an optimal outcome, resetting the inflation target from the flexible target of 2% it announced two years ago would hurt the Fed's credibility,"" they noted.",-1,-1

He could have been angry. He could have been spiteful instead he reached across the aisle on important issues. At the time Romney was the Republican nominee too. Obama/Biden were definitely trying to be fair. It was a key reason why he picked Biden and it was a campaign promise and the GOP resisted. Romney even tried to distance himself from the health care bill. At the end of the term having been told that Russia was trying to influence the election he decided to bring McConnell and I think Paul Ryan to seek their opinions on how to proceed. His concern was it might influence the election against Trump, they agreed and decided with the course of action we all saw in 2016.

But in seeing my children become parents and their friends having kids, the reality that as the little ones approach school age the panic that there could be a shooting is real.  They grew up post Columbine with shooting drills and it’s only gotten worse as their babies are going to school.

12835,"i cant speak for the mary part of the catholic church as im not catholic but worshipping the crucifix is an easy one. Back in the older days of the faith, they changed symbols constantly that meant different meanings depending on where they are adopted from. At one point the faith used a pentagram due to its spiritual connection to the elements and the human soul. In response, an inverted pentagram came to exist as an anti church protest symbol. response? they made the inverted pentagram a satanic symbol. You see the same treatment of the Cross and inverted cross. Different Crosses have been used by different sects, some of which were denounced by each other. The Ichthys or jesus fish is just another symbol adopted by a Jesus oriented faith even though its origins date back to the  2nd century, its gotten more popular in the modern day due to the darker nature of the cross. It was actually used BEFORE the cross/crucifix was adopted, around the 11th century and really took off in the 14th. So they didnt really start that whole crucifix shit till a good 1000 years after jesus, most likely as a form of intimidation and control.

The old faiths were heavy in sacrificial and morbid worship and claimed jesus' blood was one of purity. This is why they chose the crucifix as it was literally coated in the blood of Christ. Its a form of sacramental seeing as it was 'blessed' by the blood of Christ. The shroud of turin was also an item that was worshipped until it's dated orgin was found to be a fake, among other items like the lance the roman knight Longinus who stabbed jesus in the rib, though again its another item that has been denounced by the faith in more recent years.

In short, the Catholics are super heavy on idol worship and aren't against stealing or outright lying, Something that is VERY not cash money from jesus' viewpoint. something most modern day Catholics eventually find out if they question the faith. Its all about control and manipulation. Though wheres theres a will theres a way and plenty of denominations exist today to cater to whoever you want to listen to, though ill remind those reading this of [Ezekiel 34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2034&version=NET). I personally have an agnostic and spiritual/pagan viewpoint, as most god fearing religions seem downright blasphemous in their current practices, i was raised southern Baptist and i can say that the elements are 100x more kind than Jehova.

If you look at Old Testament God, you'll see one that could be swayed from wrath, particularly in the case of Sodom and Gomorrah, if at least 10 righteous people could be found.  You can also look at the story of Job for another example where God was willing to be a little flexible in some ways.

In the New Testament, the only example immediately coming to mind is when Jesus is being crucified and he pleads with God to forgive those crucifying him ""for they know not what they do"", which seems to imply God is at least able to be moved by pleas and prayers in some cases.

As for Mary, I'm not sure if there's a documented example in church history where God changed his mind becasue of her (but I could be forgetting).  You might find examples where someone asked for Mary's intercession and their prayers were later answered, particularly in cases where she is alleged to have appeared to one or more people.

In all of this though, I think we have to come back to the idea that Catholics do believe in free will.  Where there's free will, there are things for which one might plea/pray to God for intervention.  And if that's the case, mightn't asking the Saints or Mary to pray to God on one's behalf not amplify one's need a little louder?",-1,-1

The other brief examples i gave did untold harm to many hundreds of thousands of people over the better part of a few hundred years, but they would of found a reason to inflict harm on them regardless during that era. Many of them are slowly regaining their good following as the truth has become more common. While the jesus fish had very little significance to the greeks, its modern day use seems largely unnecessary with its resurgence due to all the symbols that they have adopted over the millennias. It just feels like marketing and kind of tarnishes the symbol's legacy and its importance, but its not my church or faith so i suppose they can do as they see fit.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthys)

to quote ""In the 1970s the ""Jesus Fish"" started to be used as an icon of modern Christianity. In 1973 the symbol and message was taken to the Aquarius Rock Festival in Nimbin, Australia. Today, it can be seen as a decal or emblem on the rear of automobiles or as pendants or necklaces as a sign that the owner is a Christian. Versions of this include an Ichthys with ""Jesus"" or ""ΙΧΘΥΣ"" in the centre, or simply the Ichthys outline by itself.\[24\] According to one writer, while many Christians hang a cross necklace or rosary inside their vehicles, ""the fish sticker on the car is a more conscious symbol of a witnessing Christian—significantly, unlike the former, it is on the outside of the car for everyone to see.""

""It has been speculated that the symbol was adopted by early Christians as a secret symbol; a shibboleth to determine if another was indeed Christian.""

The irony is, the symbol appears to be adopted as to serve the exact OPPOSITE of its original purpose. It was originally used as a 'hide in plain sight', now its being used as a symbol of 'everyone will know what faith i follow'.",-1,-1

Like John Lennon said, paraphrasing... it comes from the universe and goes back into the universe, and I'm just a vessel.  So are you. So is everyone.

&#x200B;

I totally agree about the swastika, what a shame to have such a beautiful symbol tarnished by evil.  I hope time straightens that out.  Not enough time has happened because not enough has changed to remove that tarnish, unfortunately.

Symbols change meaning with the circumstances that surround them.  Often the meaning is reversed over time.  Look at what the rightwing is doing to language right now in real time for examples.  

Plus, this is the most rapid rate of change in our history as a species.  And it's accelerating.

12966,">Republicans in Florida for many years had dominated mail-in voting in the state, but that shifted over the past few cycles, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. During the 2022 elections, about 2.7 million Floridians voted by mail, with 43 percent of the ballots cast by Democrats compared with 36 percent from Republicans.

That's Republican legislators' cue to restrict mail ballots! Hear that thunder? That's the sound of their footsteps rumbling to submit new restrictions",-1,-1
12967,I get why republicans only like rich white men but 70 percent of their voters are trailer trash. Especially in Florida. I just don’t see what these people get for their vote,-1,-1

The Constitution gives Congress the ability to do so. SCOTUS has also upheld and acknowledged this power in saying ""*Thus, it is well settled that the Elections Clause grants Congress ‘the power to override state regulations’ by establishing uniform rules for federal elections, binding on the States*"".

There's also the entire National Voter Registration Act of 1993 which, among other things, requires states to use specific forms to register people for elections (which SCOTUS even upheld later that year). And it also allows people to submit their voter registration by mail.

So there is ample precedence, both legislative and judicial, that reinforces the idea that Congress is able to supersede state election laws.",-1,-1

Fun Fact: In [Johnson v. Johnson](https://law.justia.com/cases/rhode-island/supreme-court/1995/654-a-2d-1212.html), a woman sued her ex-husband after he called her a whore in a crowded restaurant in Cranston, RI. 

For his defense, the man argued that his ex-wife was, in fact, a whore.

In the ruling, the judge went out of his way to note that the plaintiff was, inarguably, *an actual whore*.  But, he continued, that fact was not a sufficient defense, as the man’s intent in saying so in a public venue was intended to harm her reputation.

I know it sounds like I’m just making shit up, but here’s the ruling, verbatim:

>There's no question in the court's mind, as suggested by Mr. Keough, that she was not of virtuous character and that she perhaps fit all of those descriptions of a whore that was given to the jury. But nonetheless, be she a whore or not, she's entitled to the protections of the law, and the law is clear and the law is that while truth is a defense, if it is uttered maliciously, it is then actionable, and that's what happened here. So that when I'm reminded of my definition of what a whore is, those definitions are all from decided cases and they all fit the plaintiff, there's no question about it; but so does the constitutional prohibition and the protection that she has, and that is that one cannot be slandered maliciously.""",-1,-1

13043,"**From reporter Marianna Sotomayor:**

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) was kicked off the House Foreign Affairs Committee in a party-line vote that followed a contentious debate on the House floor Thursday morning that included yelling and Omar defending herself on the verge tears.

House Republicans had set their sights on removing Omar after she had made what Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) recently described as “repeated antisemitic and anti-American remarks” throughout her time as a member of the House. The resolution, once adopted, would explicitly condemn Omar for using an antisemitic trope to suggest Israel’s allies in U.S. politics were motivated by money rather than principle when she in 2019 tweeted, “It’s all about the Benjamins baby.”

The resolution also disapproves of Omar’s critiques of Israel and her comparison of actions by the United States to those of terrorist groups. She later clarified those comments, saying, “I was in no way equating terrorist organizations with democratic countries with well-established judicial systems.”

Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), while noting that Omar has made mistakes, forcefully defended her in a Thursday morning news conference, saying: “What’s going to take place on the floor today is not a public policy debate. It’s not about accountability. It’s about political revenge.”

Omar, a refugee from Somalia, is one of the first Muslim women to serve in the House of Representatives and often faces death threats and other threats of violence. Her office told The Post that violent threats had increased considerably since she has been in the news again. On Wednesday, Omar tweeted an expletive-laden voice mail she received this week in which a man said, “I’ll put a bullet in your f------ head and get the f--- out of my country.”

“These threats increase whenever Republicans put a target on my back,” she wrote. “They can continue to target me, but they will never stop me from fighting for a more just world.”

13112,"""New McCarthyism"".

One may not always agree with Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who has made some troubling statements in the past, in my humble opinion, but she does have 1) the right to free speech, and 2) the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.

To call decisions, policies, and/or practices of the State of Israel into question is not *de facto* anti-semitism, in my humble opinion.  There is no state in the world that is above being called to account, whether by its own citizens or the citizens of another country.  Anti-semitism moves beyond mere questioning and calling to account, and is motivated by baseless hatred.

Even if one agrees that certain statements made by Ilhan Omar about the State of Israel are of legitimate concern, her removal from the Foreign Affairs Committee smacks of racism and partisan ""witch-hunt"" tactics, being fueled by a male Speaker against a fellow member of the House who is a woman belonging to both an ethnic and religious minority in our country.

Ilhan Omar has been forcibly removed from the Foreign Affairs Committee for statements which she has made about the State of Israel, while Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) believes in ""Jewish Space Laser"" conspiracies, yet continues to sit on the Oversight and Homeland Security Committees...

...and even more egregious, George Santos (R-NY) continues to occupy a seat in the House of Representatives which was fraudulently won...

This is my opinion as a Jewish woman of color who loves the State of Israel, who is working for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and who is an Independent voter and concerned citizen born in the United States of America.",-1,-1
13113,I don't recall anything she has said about Israel or the US that was untrue.,-1,-1

Republicans have accomplished nothing",-1,-1
13118,"While I disagree with republican motives regarding her removal I do have my own problems with how she's acted as a representative and committee member. 

For starters she voted ""present"" on a bill back in 2019 that would have acknowledged and condemned Turkey for the Armenian genocide, along with sanctions against Turkey for supporting militia groups in Syria that were targeting Kurds. While her statement regarding her decision wasn't completely without merit. She should have still voted yes if she truly believed in her commitment to human rights abuses, that's not to say she couldn't have complained about why the bill was introduced, but to vote present merely out of a concern for politics seems quite underwhelming for someone who claims to be concerned with human rights abuses. 

My next concern is one of the organizations she said should investigate and charge US personnel with war crimes instead of American Courts. Now I don't have a problem with this idea on the surface, especially with laws like the ""The Hague Invasion Act,"" and I don't have a problem with her pointing out that there are and have been war crimes committed by US troops. My concern is more with the organization she said that should charge these accused war criminals with. The International Criminal Court shouldn't be the overseer of such cases when they refuse to [even investigate a genocide going on in China.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/15/world/asia/icc-china-uighur-muslim.html) If this organization is going to play geopolitics in favor of some nations but not others than they have no right to investigate human rights violations when they're playing favoritism. 

I don't know if these concerns should be enough for her dismissal as a committee member, however, I do think she should be called out on biases and geopolitical favoritism, especially if it doesn't reflect on what congress believes regarding its own foreign policy considering she is/was a committee member but that's just me.",-1,-1

Remember that Republicans are more than willing to abandon their so called ""values"" if it's in the name of spite or preserving their culture war.

In fact, Republicans spend a considerable amount of their time and energy doing just that, finding ways to justify their inherently discriminatory or suppresive measures. 

They'll disguise it as some noble achievement or some counterrevolutionary effort, thus indulging their voter's sense of ""patriotism"", but a vast majority of the time it's either a double standard, or it's part of some ""stick it to the libs"" vindictive crusade, both steeped in a deep-rooted sense of entitlement and a growing right-wing chauvinism. 

This is all while they have the audacity to feign the victim, to claim how they're one of the most persecuted groups in this country.

Omar was removed for being antisemitic (aka saying that the US/Israel relationship is all based on money). MTG said she no longer believes what she said, but that change of heart came after the threat of removal.

The GOP thinks this means MTG was kicked off for a fake reason and Omar for a real one, and democrats think this means that Omar was kicked off for a fake reason and MTG a real one.

I mean, you're not wrong. Even in the House, our so-called ""of the people"" legislative chamber, the [solid red/blue districts on this map](https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/comments/xg9y5w/seeing_it_on_a_map_puts_into_perspective_how/) are considered non-competitive. Largely a consequence of partisan gerrymandering at the state level.

Of the top 4 most populous states in the country, 122/144 races are non-competitive:

* 44 of California's 52 House districts are non-competitive
* 35 of Texas' 38 House districts, non-competitive
* 25 of Florida's 28 House districts, non-competitive
* 18 of New York's 26 House districts, non-competitive

And the ratio is even worse in the less populated states. Just 15% of House races across the country *aren't already in the bag.* In any election, that's about 60 of 435 total House seats that aren't already decided. That's a travesty in a ""democracy"". And due to gerrymandering and the capped seat count, Republicans don't even need to get a majority of total votes in order to get a majority of seats.

The House has been capped at 435 since 1929. And House seats determine the number of Electoral College votes. If the disparity between the population of the most and least populous states continues to grow, the disproportionality of the House will expand unless the seats are increased. Without change, the cap will continue to corrupt how our presidents are elected. See: r/UncapTheHouse

At this point, the entire Constitution needs a complete rewrite top to bottom. All of our institutions have been captured and corrupted by the elites: House, Senate, SCOTUS, Electoral College, etc. We are in dire need of a new government that actually represents the people.

Israel ≠ Jews.

. Currently, Swiss legislation bans the use of automatic weapons, silencers, laser sights, and heavy machine guns.

Practically everyone in Switzerland is trained to use a gun, yes, but that training, as well as the use, storage, and transportation of guns, is very regulated.

13630,"> Currently, Swiss legislation bans the use of automatic weapons, silencers, laser sights, and heavy machine guns. 

The paperwork for a full auto firearm is faster than in the US, takes about 2 weeks, though it's not legal in every Canton (state), similar to how it's not legal in every state in the US (though it takes much longer in the US and you're limited to firearms registered before 1986).  


Silencers are not particularly hard to get. Slightly harder than in many other country in Europe though. Even in the UK a suppressor is fairly easy to get. In the US the process for a suppresor is the same as buying a machine gun.  


Laser sights might actually be regulated, I'm not entirely sure.

  
Heavy machine guns are not regulated in the Swiss gun law at all.

&#x200B;

>The government demands licensing for the acquisition and carrying of any firearm

Carry (as in for self-defense) yes (and it's only available for professional use, really), for acquisition no.  


For manual action long guns you need an ID and a criminal records extract, no further paperwork than that.  


For a semi-automatic long gun or for handguns, you need a shall issue acquisition permit, which is really the Swiss equivalent to your 4473/NICS that you do when you purchase a firearm in a store.  


The difference is that the acquisition permit is posted to you and you bring it with you, instead of doing it directly in the store. It takes about 1 week to get, and is valid for 3 guns at the same time and location (just get more permits if you want more guns). I.e. it's faster to buy an AR-15 and 2 handguns, than it is in states like California (because they have a 10 day waiting period and max 1 semi-auto rifle/handgun per month).  


>and requires registration and licenses for ownership of firearms

Firearms sold after 2008 are registered with the local Canton police. If you buy firearms in Geneva and move to Bern, the latter will have no idea that you have guns.  


Ownership isn't regulated, purchasing is. And as I mentioned earlier, that does not require a license.

&#x200B;

>with some exceptions made for hunting weapons. 

Not sure what that exception would be. The process is the same for the type of firearms I've mentioned, no matter if you sell privately or buy from a store, or if you're a hunter or not.  


>Practically everyone in Switzerland is trained to use a gun, yes, but that training, as well as the use,

There are zero training requirements to own a firearm. And if you think everyone has done military service, that's also wrong. Conscription is mandatory for males who are Swiss citizens, which is only 38% of the total population, and since 1996 you can choose between civil service and military service (and the latter also has unarmed options). About 17% of the total population of any given birthyear has done military service.

&#x200B;

>storage

By court ruling, your locked front door is considered safe storage. It's not illegal to store your firearm loaded either. You can literally hang a loaded AR15 on your wall and it would be legal.  


> transportation of guns

This is regulated yes, can't have cartridges loaded, not even filled in a magazine that's not attached in the firearm.   


It's however not particularly strict of how and where you transport it. The military instruction video tells you that it's okay to store your service rifle in the trunk of your car when you go and grab a beer with your buddies.

Desantis is going for a full 6 week - no exceptions for rape or incest - abortion ban.

Desantis is requiring girls to submit their period information in order to play sports. (Ultimately parents will sue because of Title 9. And I think the US Supreme Court will pick up the case to overturn Title 9. Title 9 doesn’t just affect sports - it protects educational access.) 

Desantis has appointed New College and University of Florida officials without allowing the college or university to have a say at all. 

Desantis split all of the Democratic areas of the state with gerrymandering.

Desantis is making all of the teachers take all books out of their classrooms. 

Meanwhile, I’m a Floridian whose electric bill is going up 20-30% this year. 

My homeowners insurance has tripled in 3 years. It probably covers nothing at this point.

If you drive on the turnpike, it’s so dusty because they took down so many trees and have so much cleared. They are going to build on the land at some point. Until then - it’s dirty.

Condos are collapsing.

To be clear NCF is an incredible institution of 700 students. it has one of the highest rates of any US tertiary education institution to have undergrads continue to their education and attain PhDs (in top 15 in nation). It has more fullbright scholars per capita in any US institution, and with only 700 students has more fullbright scholars in absolute numbers than almost any institution (so not per capita). Among  their 3000 alumni includes the ex head of the NY federal reserve and a fields medalist.

They might not even have a major issue with the policies or what he was trying to do in office as much as they just disliked his behavior, much of which was unnecessary.

So, DeSantis is dangerous because he might be able to continue the horrible and harmful policy while also not turning away those that were turned away by Trump's ridiculous behavior.

13755,"**From reporters Cate Cadell, John Hudson and Yasmeen Abutaleb:**  
President Biden postponed his top diplomat’s first official trip to China on Friday in response to the Pentagon’s discovery of an alleged Chinese spy balloon flying over the continental United States, said a U.S. official familiar with the matter.  
  
The decision came just hours before Secretary of State Antony Blinken was scheduled to depart for Beijing in a dramatic indication of how seriously the Biden administration takes the incident and wants to avoid appearing soft on China.  
  
The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  
  
Since the outset of his presidency, Biden has been sensitive to Republican criticisms that he is insufficiently tough on China, though on the issue of canceling the trip, Republicans were divided on the matter. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas called on the administration to cancel the trip while House Speaker Kevin McCarthy demanded a Gang of Eight intelligence briefing from the president on the balloon.  
  
Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee encouraged Blinken to use the trip to send a tough message to China regarding the suspected spy balloon. But U.S. officials appeared to be concerned about the optics of the visit in wake of the incursion, even though experts said the incident, even if an act of espionage, was not remarkable.  
  
“All countries, especially competitors like the United States and China, spy on each other. It’s a fact of international relations, and has been forever,” said Jacob Stokes, an expert at the Center for a New American Security and a former Obama administration official. “And we know PRC intelligence extensively targets America.

13758,So Americans are butt hurt because they think a Chinese balloon is doing to them what US sattelites are doing all over the world.,-1,-1
13759,One thing I don't understand is why the US waited until it got into Montana to take action publicly. The balloon did fly over Alaska as well and likely a very long stretch of Canada. You physically can't enter Montana without first getting into Canada or elsewhere in the US.,-1,-1

13764,"In 1995 Norway forgot to tell russia about a planned missile launch, rather than launching their nukes they called Norway and were like “hey did you guys forget to tell us something or share we ending the world”. Norway had an oh shit moment and then everything was fine. 

Point is governments are wise not to jump to the worst possible conclusions and that included marking sure their citizens aren’t wildly firing guns into the air. They released the info when they realized China wasn’t going to do anything about it and it was in a location where everyone wouldn’t lose their minds.",-1,-1
13765,"**From reporter Aaron Blake about why the shooting-down strategy may not be so simple:**

The Pentagon’s [stated reason](https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3287204/senior-defense-official-holds-a-background-briefing-on-high-altitude-surveillan/) for not shooting down the balloon yet is the danger it could pose to civilians on the ground. And it says it doubts the information being gleaned from the balloon would be more significant than what China is already obtaining via other means, such as satellites.  
  
“We had been looking at whether there was an option yesterday over some sparsely populated areas in Montana,” a senior defense official said. “But we just couldn’t buy down the risk enough to feel comfortable recommending shooting it down yesterday.”  
  
The official added that “our best assessment at the moment is that whatever the surveillance payload is on this balloon, it does not create significant value added over and above what \[China\] is likely able to collect through things like satellites in low Earth orbit.”

Officials must be also considering what kind of precedent would be set by shooting it down, both for the United States and its adversaries. There could also be value observing the balloon — and a downside to showing China and others how we would dispatch such a threat.  
  
All of which was noted Friday by a rare Republican skeptic of the just-shoot-it-down strategy. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) suggested that the balloon could be an attempt by China to “bait the United States into disputes over appropriate rights in the air.”

Aaron dives more into the history of aerial surveillance in the U.S. here: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/02/03/chinese-balloon-aerial-surveillance-history/?utm\_campaign=wp\_main&utm\_medium=social&utm\_source=reddit.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/02/03/chinese-balloon-aerial-surveillance-history/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit.com)

13768,They also wouldn't just shoot something down that is clearly just a show. Why escalate matters?,-1,-1

13770,"That's the other strange piece -- the US could have contacted China when it first got into Alaska. They would have worked something out in the meantime. Of course we don't yet know if that did happen, but it doesn't look like it did, because nobody has mentioned that. I don't understand this either: why wouldn't the US just as a gesture of caution contact China and say ""hey we noticed a balloon over Alaska, want to figure out a solution before it potentially figuratively blows up in case it reaches somewhere much less peripheral?""",-1,-1
13771,"It's saying why the US didn't shoot it down once it's in Montana. But my question is why the US only took public action until it reached Montana, when it did go through Alaska earlier.

But yeah, the whole thing is a bit odd. China has said it was ""mainly meteorological purposes"" which just makes me question the ""mainly"" part of that explanation. And they said it veered off course due to unexpected winds. Supposedly it was tracked going over the Aleutian Islands, through Canada, and now spotted over Montana. But weather balloons tend to only travel like 100 miles.",-1,-1

13780,Ringing up the Chinese right when we detected the balloon is a great way to let the Chinese know our sensing abilities. Waiting until it was halfway across the continent before going public with the detection is far less helpful to the PLA.,-1,-1
13781,I could see the US waiting to see whether China would say something first.,-1,-1

Edit: wording",-1,-1
13785,That theory doesn't explain why the US has mentioned an official sighting over the Aleutian Islands -- pretty much the earliest place you'd expect the US to take notice.,-1,-1
13786,"I see -- but that still feels really risky. 

1) if China knows and doesn't want to say anything, for any reason, including idk say embarrassment -- then the US would certainly escalate the situation much more by making a big reveal in Montana than when it was just in Alaska or crossed into northern Canada. I'm just not quite sure how this would be in the US' interest -- although it would be a solid reason, but ultimately not a major one, to postpone the Blinken visit, if that's what the US wants (which...it would still be pretty weird). It's certainly not at all conducive to a better relationship or easing tensions between the countries.

2) *if* China somehow doesn't know about the balloon, then the wait wouldn't even make sense. To wait, the US must have intelligence that the Chinese state 1) has active knowledge of the balloon, at least of its existence and its path, and also 2) recognises the ballon as an intelligence balloon of the state, which would spark a diplomatic row, instead of anything else for which it might not feel the need to say anything.",-1,-1

13890,"Former President Donald Trump’s copyright claim in a lawsuit against author Bob Woodward faces several major obstacles while touching on unsettled questions about intellectual property rights over recorded interviews.  
  
Trump’s litigation against Woodward, his publisher Simon & Schuster Inc., and its parent Paramount Global targeted the release of audio recordings of 2019 and 2020 interviews without permission.  
  
He’s demanding $50 million and seeking a court order declaring that his responses are creative expressions that grant him sole authorship over the recordings, a copyright that would extend to derivative works such as Woodward’s audiobook, “The Trump Tapes: Bob Woodward’s Twenty Interviews with President Donald Trump.”  
  
That copyright claim could sink on several grounds, according to copyright lawyers who largely regard the claim—on the whole—as frivolous. Intuition suggests to many that an interviewee has no expectation of being able to prevent an interviewer from using their responses.",-1,-1
13891,"Filing frivolous lawsuits to cause his detractors to incur legal fees and to attract attention is, of course, a Trump tradition.

When he sued biographer Timothy O'Brien in 2006, he repeatedly claimed that his intent was to bankrupt him.   His publisher, Warner Books, paid all of his legal fees.

Get ready for Trump to sue C-Span for broadcasting his State of the Union Addresses.",-1,-1
13892,"I would be super surprised if courts ruled that merely speaking is enough to grant copyright. Everyone will sue everyone else, people will be afraid to speak in general because they have nothing wholly original to say. Except maybe ""let me laminate my testicles and then have them bronzed."" Pretty sure that was original.",-1,-1
13893,"""Intriguing"" is not a word I'd like to hear from an IP lawyer in reference to my argument's merit, myself. That's usually code for ""somewhere between naive and ignorant"" in my experience.",-1,-1
13894,"He's trying to say something like ""I was a private citizen being recorded, not the president acting in his official capacity, so I deserve to be compensated for the use of my voice.""

FTA:

“What was really the compelling aspect of this? It was hearing Trump’s voice, hearing him articulate it with the expression in his voice,” Garson said. “Otherwise the newsworthy aspects are in the original book.”",-1,-1

13896,After all the whole point is to have the recordings to draw from while writing the article or book,-1,-1

13899,"The article skims over the criticism by IP attorneys and various legal experts that Trump's legal filing in this case, like most of them, is a piece of garbage.

Biden’s administration has broken with more than 40 years of anti-government orthodoxy to fashion a new economic strategy—investing in people, investing in places.

13925,"If you have a dog like this be mindful of a condition called ""happy tail"" and try to keep them from slamming their tail into furniture and corners as much as you can. They'll break their tails and get cuts all over them, etc. It can result in the need for amputation which is a pretty rough surgery for older dogs.

In this example I would just call the dog further into the room so the tail isn't smacking the door frame repeatedly. Pretty simple stuff that can prevent a bunch of expensive vet bills and general all-round misery.",-1,-1

14025,Had a Great Dane growing up that would wag his tail so hard he’d sometimes break it open on hard surfaces and sling blood everywhere.

14097,Does anyone who owns a chihuahua own just one chihuahua? I don't believe so.,-1,-1
14098,You can ask anyone that knows me and they'll say I am not a fan of chihuahuas but I still admit their clwar excitement to go for a ride is very cute.,-1,-1
14099,In their micromobile,-1,-1
14100,Cutest. Thing.  Ever.,-1,-1
14101,Chihuahua clown car 😂,-1,-1

14104,Goals!,-1,-1
14105,"I wish it was that easy to get my cats into their carrier...

Though I suppose when the only time you leave the house is to go to the vets ...  You probably wouldn't be too eager to get in either...",-1,-1
14106,The excitement,-1,-1
14107,"My chihuahuas love getting into bags, they even get inside my sports bag if I dont close it.",-1,-1
14108,"Lol, the one that jumps back out, panics about being forgotten and then jumps back in",-1,-1

14111,"I never was chihuahua fan, but we have one Chiweenie and a long hair.  They are the most loving dogs I’ve ever had and great watch dogs.  Yea they’re loud at times but they’re very protective.",-1,-1

14118,"That’s something you don’t see everyday. Well, maybe you do. I sure don’t.",-1,-1
14119,This would be terrifying if played in reverse.,-1,-1
14120,ahhhh they're so tiny :D,-1,-1
14121,Jesus that’s a big bag of happiness or perhaps naked unprovoked aggression right there. Either way it’s pretty exciting!,-1,-1
14122,Freakin rats but still there cute.,-1,-1
14123,Ugh leave those obnoxious rats at home. Nobody wants to be around them.,-1,-1

14135,"I love this!

They’re so excited 🐾",-1,-1
14136,Every time I see one of theses dogs I think of how Les Nessman on the TV show WKRP in Cincinnati pronounced chihuahua. Called them ‘chee-hooah-hooahs’.,-1,-1
14137,They’re so excited they literally can’t contain themselves!,-1,-1
14138,I love how excited they are,-1,-1
14139,"Aww it makes me remember my two dogs who passed away. Everytime I put their bags on the floor, they just started walking towards them and get in themselves.",-1,-1
14140,Thats adoreable,-1,-1
14141,Hmm… wonder who the pack leader is? Lol,-1,-1

14181,u/bigbluechevy2007 the last long hair'd brown one is actually pretty cute lol,-1,-1
14182,They love it!!,-1,-1
14183,Lol my exact thought was “what is this? A clown car for cheewowwows.”    (I spelled it like I pronounced it in my head),-1,-1
14184,A bag full of rats.,-1,-1
14185,Damn it I was going to say that XD,-1,-1
14186,A doggie bag.,-1,-1
14187,And yet all those pups still require less kibbles than my German Shepherd…,-1,-1
14188,They allotted a lot of space for their residents.,-1,-1
14189,Cutest way to die ever,-1,-1
14190,Justice,-1,-1
14191,"Get in, loser, we're going shopping!",-1,-1
14192,But for how long after midnight? Because these cuties clearly need their food.,-1,-1

The younger one would beam around super happy, jump in, and he both loved and hated car rides.",-1,-1
14199,"As soon as we get within 20 feet of my car, my chi mix will start pulling in the opposite direction. She hates car rides and I wish I could make them better for her!",-1,-1
14200,I too prefer my chihuahuas off their period.,-1,-1
14201,"My first thought as well! I generally view Reddit muted and sometimes turn the sound on.

I thought “ohh god. That many little yappers; this is going to be a complete bark fest.”",-1,-1
14202,My take away is that I need more chihuahuas so there will be less barking!,-1,-1
14203,They’re too frigin happy to be jammin on outta da house,-1,-1
14204,"At least 5, according to this example!",-1,-1
14205,Yes.,-1,-1
14206,Better get 7 just to be safe!!,-1,-1

14208,Yeah how many can fit in til they can’t anymore?,-1,-1
14209,Never?,-1,-1
14210,And I deserve the rest of the video! I want to see their adventures!,-1,-1
14211,I'm told it's like potato chips.,-1,-1
14212,Yeah they look like they hate it,-1,-1
14213,At least rats don't bark incessantly at everything and nothing at all. They bark so much that it doesn't even help to alert you to anything because you become so desensitized that you only just want them to shut up.,-1,-1
14214,"Wowowow, rats are awesome",-1,-1
14215,"Serious question: What's your argument against them? Why do you call them ""the absolute worst of the worst breed of dogs""?",-1,-1

14228,I loved asking my collie if he'd like to go for a ride.  It was more excitement than the ride.  He'd stick his nose in the air and run around making Chewabacca sounds.,-1,-1
14229,Sure but you get a good discount at around 9. That's when you really start feeling the savings.,-1,-1
14230,I have never seen one just chilling.,-1,-1
14231,"I think it’s pits personally, but chihuahuas are predisposed to congenital hydrocephalus, which **can** cause extra pressure on the brain and can cause behavioral issues via chronic pain. I mean, when I’m in pain, it’s a lot harder for me to be calm and cheerful. 

I also just don’t like that their digestive tract will always make their shits smell like the spawn of Satan",-1,-1
14232,"Same, I was waiting for their barks when I unmuted the video. But my ears were met with happy tippy taps instead.",-1,-1
14233,My lil dude chilled out a ton after he grew up,-1,-1
14234,My childhood chihuahua would let me hold him like a baby while spoon feeding him. I was under 5 y/o. Just depends on the dog and the person they are interacting with,-1,-1

14237,That's all mine is doing all day long lol. Wish she was more energetic.,-1,-1
14238,"If they are responsibly bred, they are far less likely to have those health complications. My chi is the sweetest little guy even around babies and other dogs. Also his poos are tiny firm little nuggets that don't really have much smell at all. At least with the diet we have him on.",-1,-1

14257,"I always make a little song when my cat kneads. 
It goes a little something like this but it's different everytime
""She's making biscuits for the biscuit shop,
Cause the hungry customers never stop,
And if she doesn't make enough biscuits,
She'll run out of biscuits and disappoint everyone, 
So she better keep on making that dough,

14387,"My used cat is right next to me taking a bath at the moment. One day in December I couldn't sleep so I checked the page from the local shelter, just looking. I found that beautiful standard issue cat, senior model and fell in love. Around 9am I mailed the shelter, around noon they called if I'd like to visit her. On the way to the shelter I bought everything from a carrier to food and toys. She instantly tolerated my existence and I was allowed to take her home with me. She didn't hide under the bed but started to check out her new home, chirping for me from time to time to reassure I'm still there. After that she hopped on my sofa and curled up next to me and took a nap. I was so overwhelmed because it all happened so fast. From the first night on she'd sleep in my bed completely at home. 

I think in both of our cases it was meant to happen.",-1,-1
14388,soo did she tip over the cup or not?,-1,-1
14389,She's beautiful. May you and your new soulmate share many years together. Thank you for giving an animal a forever home.,-1,-1

14407,"The slow blinks! 😻 She obviously loves you.

Cats don’t have a lot of the logical stuff figured out, but they’re very good at detecting and communicating emotions.

I’m sorry to hear that you’re dealing with what happened to you. I’m an Iraq veteran and I just want you to know that it does get easier. Furry friends help a lot. I wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for mine, giving me unconditional love and a reason to get up in the morning.",-1,-1

14422,She is beautiful!,-1,-1
14423,When cats knead it usually means they are content and comfortable (they imitate what they did as babies when they were drinking their mom milk). So your cat doing it when you talk to it means she consider your voice to be soothing (her closing her eyes shows that too),-1,-1
14424,"Wishing you both many years of purrs, health and happiness ♥️",-1,-1

14661,no she's not !,-1,-1

14663,😭😭😭😭😭😭,-1,-1
14664,she's two :),-1,-1
14665,thank you so much for the kind words. my PTSD comes from something that is nowhere near what veterans must experience... i can't imagine how tough that is. sending you strength and grateful you have a furry friend❤️,-1,-1
14666,"Nah, that cat is actually quite happy. You can tell by the slow eye blink, which, fun fact, you can do right back at them if you want to make quick friends or just make your cats more comfy. 


Basically prolonged eye contact is a sign of aggression for cats.",-1,-1
14667,hazel !,-1,-1
14668,hazel !,-1,-1
14669,hazel !! ❤️,-1,-1
14670,She is giving you slow blinks! Cat language for 'I love you'. Make sure you slow blink back at her ❤️,-1,-1
14671,Aww she's giving you the lovey eyes. And the happy little tippy taps. That is one contented kitty. Such a difference from her shelter picture.,-1,-1
14672,I just want anything to look at me like she looks at you haha.,-1,-1
14673,She’s so clearly more content and sure of herself. Those beautiful eyes are no longer unsure*),-1,-1

14675,"shelters are good for providing necessities like food and shelter, but a lot of animals, particularly cats, are not comfortable there at all. she probably wanted out of the noise and chaos. thank you for taking her home to her house and letting her adopt you.",-1,-1
14676,That look! She’s like “GET ME THE HECK OUTTA HERE!”,-1,-1
14677,LMAOOO i was not expecting her eyes to be so BIG. I'm glad she was able to find a furever home with you and not have to be in the look out so much anymore lol,-1,-1
14678,Awe i love her! She looks like my spike. He belonged to my awful neighbors that never provided warmth or safety to him. He would visit me every day so I set him up a heated shelter on my porch. One day he decided he wasn't going back home. After they had him neutered at my constant urging he was attacked badly by a neighbor cat leaving scars and ripping out his nails. They left him out in the freezing weather to recover from both. I brought him in at night and he was fine with them. He's been with me now for years. The owner's mother told me after she was so glad I kept him because her son took terrible care of him. He's my whole heart. As a dog person I never thought I could live a cat like this.,-1,-1
14679,"Wow, you're her angel.",-1,-1
14680,Omg. She’s like an entirely different cat!!,-1,-1
14681,i wouldn't even think they're the same cat 😭🥹 amazing transformation!!!,-1,-1

14694,🥺❤️,-1,-1
14695,I will never stop loving these adoption stories. I know people don't always expect to have a cat fall in their lap but you certainly prepared very well!,-1,-1
14696,"This story is so wholesome, congrats on the beautiful baby",-1,-1
14697,congratulations on being adopted by your cat! she looks so sweet,-1,-1
14698,Why is everyone typing like this !,-1,-1

14706,That friendly wee curled tail. So cute!,-1,-1
14707,It's PERFECT,-1,-1
14708,"She is precious. I absolutely adore cats and have 3 of my own - I had 6, but lost 3 over the past 5 years,  due to old age. 

Honestly, I loved reading your responses to questions in this post as you genuinely seem to love & appreciate her. So many people get cats without realizing how much care and attention they need to live a happy, fulfilled life. People who say ""cats are independent"" don't understand that a happy cat will be VERY social, very interactive,  or at least want to be near their humans as much as possible.  When my cats are left alone in the morning,  or *think* they are alone,  they howl for a few minutes, while walking around,  looking for us!! Lol.

Anyway sorry to go off on such a tangent, it is just really nice to see someone who obviously loves and appreciates this sweet baby. Thank you for saving her from shelter life and giving her a forever home❤",-1,-1
14709,"Yup, she's probably so happy that she gets to live with one really nice human instead of in a room with like 30 other cats with varying personalities.",-1,-1
14710,fr i loaded the image and did not expect to see a shellshocked gato looking like she just served two tours abroad😭🥺,-1,-1
14711,Cats are so much more emotionally mature than a lot of people give them credit for. They know when you care.,-1,-1
14712,her name is Hazel !,-1,-1
14713,"thank you so much ! she could not have come at a better time - your comment is exactly right. i've been dealing with PTSD from something that happened to me on new year's day last month, and she is for sure saving me over again every day.",-1,-1
14714,"This one hits home for me since it matches perfectly with my cat adopting experience. I wanted to get her during the pandemic, but I had to wait over 3 weeks for my appointment to go into the shelter. In fact, I didn’t even get to personally meet her during the adoption process due to Covid. She waited for me, and she’s now queen of the house.",-1,-1
14715,A Schnoodle! Piping hot and fresh! And this post that was so beautiful! I'm doubly blessed! ❤❤❤,-1,-1

14728,help in a furry jacket - i adore that. thank you for the kind words🥰,-1,-1
14729,"I adopted a bonded pair of kitties last summer and one was really skittish about being touched or petted, so for months I would “pet” her from a distance with slow blinks.  Once she started blinking back, I knew we were going to be fine. 

She will now allow me to pet her when *she* requests to be petted and gives big purrs in exchange.

14730,"My grandmother used to call her cat her ‘little furry Valium’ - but having experience of both working in cat rescue and having taken Valium for PTSD, I can tell you the cats are a lot more effective! 

Those long slow blinks are her equivalent of kisses - saying she trusts you so much she can close her eyes and not have to be on alert for predators because she knows she is safe with you. It is the highest compliment in cat communication. I imagine she hasn't felt safe in a long time so the fact it has happened so quickly says you're going to have a very special bond indeed.",-1,-1

14780,Not just a good boy. The best boy. With excellent pooch hugs!,-1,-1

2. Make sure she can’t get anywhere that wildlife could be.",-1,-1

14876,"Evolution takes millions of years, it doesn’t happen overnight. Our current ecosystems have evolved concurrently over millennia and anything we destroy won’t recover in our lifetimes, maybe not in our species’ lifetime. The only reason so many are collapsing now is because we’re in the middle of a mass extinction event largely accelerated by humans and our habit of introducing invasive species everywhere we go. It’s not supposed to be that way, biologists have been sounding the alarm for years that we’re headed down a path that we can’t come back from and that will have major implications on human society.",-1,-1

Four days ago we saw a vet who suspects she developed an inflammatory condition similar to MS in humans. We started her on steroids and she has been improving since!

While MS is widely accepted to have contribution from auto-reactive T-cells causing partial demyelination, GME has been found to have high levels of lymphocytes and macrophages causing granulomas, inflammation, and perivascular infiltration (but no necessarily demyelination). 

Although I compared the two, it was more so based on the presentation (sudden and diffuse motor symptoms) rather than the pathogenesis :)",-1,-1

If I had all the money in the world, I would get her an MRI asap to rule this in/out. Unfortunately, my husband and I are not made of money, I am in medical school so that already makes things tight.

15123,"I believe it was granulomatous meningoencephalitis. The onset of symptoms were tremors (she would be very visibly shaking), difficulty walking (started with not being able to jump up on the couch or bed at first, but then walking altogether), she was eventually unable to hold her head up to eat (possibly a stiff neck).

They ended up seeing a specialist who put her on, I believe, an immunosuppressant and steroids. Initially they thought it might resolve with medication, but each time they ramped down the medication the symptoms would come back. Eventually they ended up finding the appropriate maintenance dose. Their girl is pretty much back to her normal self with the little bit of medication each day.

It sounds like it may possibly be what is going on, but I’m certainly not a vet. If your vet is not as experienced with diagnosing and treating these types of conditions, perhaps there is a specialist they might be able to recommend?

It's pretty common in desert areas (I lived in Tucson, and it was a risk for pets and people there). It's not something you would even see. They're spores that would get kicked up out of the dirt and settle into the lungs. They can cause all sorts of problems if they spread.

“He’s a lab, and well, if I’m 56, that means the dog is probably about 45-46?”

I had to take a moment to digest this, and asked as politely as possible “-in dog years?” 

“No, this was my childhood dog. He’s 46 years old.”

Again, I had to pause to assess if she was crazy, but she was absolutely dead serious, and a bit indignant that I questioned her.

I just jotted it down for the appointment and sent her on her way. My coworker nearby had overheard, and we reasoned that her dad had probably replaced the family dogs a few times over the years, and this poor naive lady was majorly in denial.

There's also some funny business that goes on in poorer countries (at least I was told about it happening when my parents were born 40-50 years ago, though it probably still happens today).  In smaller villages they don't have proper documentation when children are born, and sometimes don't get any until a few years later when they travel to the bigger city where those services are available.  I have been told by someone that their family used to age-up their kids when they got documentation, so they would be able to vote/retire/etc sooner (and presumably reap other benefits).

Lots of dog breeds are born white and darken with age.  Just like humans, born blonde hair blue eyed and darken over time.  For example, Dalmatians are born without spots, Pomeranians are born with white fluff that turns to brown or red as they mature.  Heelers, which have pretty crazy coat colors and patterns as adults start out snow white and that’s just what I can think of off hand.

So, hoping you're not one of them and beforehand telling i have no qualms with the prospect that this all might be faked, here's i think it's most likely that there wasn't a switch.

First, people are pointing to a 1999 picture, and most specifically to the front paws, to allude that it isn't the same dog. Ok, now consider how fat he is now and take that into account. It's only normal that he looks different. As for the white fur in his paws, in the videos of him walking around, you see the white fur still there, but it has been shifted downwards. It's still quite noticeable on his right paw, while on the left paw it retreated a fair bit more. Now if you ever had puppies, you see them grow up and you notice instantly that they look quite different when they grow up. The same goes for gaining a ton of weight as he aged.

As for the other remark people make about switching the dog's registration, unless they'd show up with a newborn puppy in 2008 at the vet and said it was the same dog and the vet was like ""sure... i buy that"" for whatever reason i cannot understand, the only other to fake it was to show up with a dog that looked 15 but was in fact just 1 year old.

Yeah, usually a dog getting fatter makes their legs look shorter, not longer.

There is white on his jowls and up to his ankle in the older photos. Dogs do not have such significant hair color changes as they get older. They get more white hairs, not fewer.

These people are asserting that it’s DEFINITELY fake, despite there being evidence (not proof, evidence) supporting the claim that the dog is indeed 30.

For me, I’d say it’s more likely true than not, since the amount of effort to go to defraud a government veterinary agency over the course of 30 years seems like a little much just to get a certificate from a book no one really cares about anymore.",-1,-1

16306,"My personal opinion on dressing your dog is that for one it must serve a purpose  warmth or protecting them following surgery, keeping a doggy diaper on if your dog is incontinent. It shouldn't matter the style or color of the clothing.. I find people will be outraged by a dog in colors but won't think twice about a dog in black.

And of course if it stresses your dog out it should be a hard no, but if it goes on easily amd they go about their day with no whites of their eyes showing or trying to get it off it is completely fine. Besides no one will think twice about who's service dog he is, haha.",-1,-1

16326,"I don't think people are ""outraged about a dog in colors"" -- people just don't like seeing you dressing up a pet like they're some accessory or doll. A dog isn't there for decoration. 

Whites of their eyes isn't the only sign of anxiety. If your dog excessively pants, fidgets, scratches, or is generally more restless when you dress him up, then he doesn't want to wear a shirt. Just because he doesn't struggle when you dress him, that doesn't mean he's enjoying it. Anxieties may build up gradually over an extended period of time.",-1,-1

16345,"He wears it out when it's cold and that's it.

There's no difference between a standard step in dog coat and a dog hoodie if you're not using the hood, especially in a very cold climate.. infact I'd rather it without the hood, it is for a functional reason and I couldn't help realizing they do matching ones for people. And it's as simple and quick to put on as a suiticle or step in dog coat, which is all it is.. it's equipped with harness holes the back too.",-1,-1
16346,"Hahah that's the best, my boy hates being wrapped in a towel for example because it'll just come off but if you put his hoodie on or one of my shirts he's happy as hell.


I hate that people judge so much over it. Because like I genuinely wouldn't do it if he didn't like it, most dogs might not like it but my boy? He likes being toasty and as a dog owner you know your dog best and certainly wouldn't buy sweaters that cost money to not be used or that our dogs hate.


 he has one hoodie he wears all winter long, keeps his organs warm.. I might get another so I can wash and rotate them.. its not about style it's comfort too.

The hood for example isn't necessary but finding good quality matching stuff for humans and dogs is hard.. but he doesn't even notice a little fabric draping on the back of his neck tucked under his work harness.

And I needed something I'd wear myself.

The only time he wears is hoodie is for trips out when it's cold because he's a fit healthy young lab so there's no need, he wore a suit after being neutered.",-1,-1

16418,"This is 100% misinformation and this redditor knows literally nothing about reading the body language of dogs because the opposite of what they say is the truth. That dog's ears are not back tightly against the skull, which is what indicates doggie discomfort or fear. In fact his ears are just simply relaxed, indicating he's relaxed. There are zero other indications of fear or discomfort in his body language. His tail isn't tucked and in fact he gives the baby a friendly lick that doesn't seem submissive at all.",-1,-1

laid tightly back against the head suggest a fearful or timid reaction.",-1,-1

They need a LOT of maintenance. Poodle mixes are extremely prone to matting and need to be brushed routinely (read, daily) and ideally professionally groomed often. 

It’s not that they don’t shed. It’s that they don’t shed normally.",-1,-1

16502,I like the style! Keep at it. You'll eventually get the hang of replicating the more complex elements with practice. A grid might help as well.,-1,-1
16503,I love it! It looks like a really cool minimalist drawing. If you wanted to add some details maybe you could keep it along those lines and maybe just add the black nose and a few lines by the ears and such? It looks cool regardless though!,-1,-1

You've done a great job so far. And try tracing paper over the photo and get the shapes of the nose, etc...

Also try stuff out on a separate canvas, a rough, to get over the feelings that you're gonna fuck it up. Fucking up is normal, as is the fear. 

Breathe.",-1,-1
16507,"It's not terrible. It's definitely wanting for at least a little detail. Maybe give that a try? like, find the most defining feature on your dog's face, like a line or a shape, and draw that. Then slowly add more features, using simple lines and shales, until you get something you like.

This boy is a relatively new addition, he's only 8 months old so I'm not super confident in his recall yet because some familial crises occurred that slowed the progress of his training, but we are getting back on track. This provides a space where he can run, we can practice recall, and don't have to worry about potential issues involved with others :)

Either due to lack of camouflage, increased interest from other animals/humans, or some other kind of medical problem that made it vulnerable.

With fur as white as snow, and eyes that stand out from the rest.  
It wanders in the night, with grace and silent pace,  
But sometimes feels alone, in this world with a different face.

It hears the whispers, of the other raccoons with fur so dark,  
And wonders why it's different, and if it's meant to leave its mark.  
But it stands tall, and with its head held high,  
For it knows, deep inside, that it's meant to fly.

It lives a life, that's not like the others,  
But it finds a way to thrive, with its own unique colours.  
It finds its own path, in a world that's full of surprise,  
And shines so bright, like a star in the sky.

So let us cherish this creature of the night,  
And all its differences, that make it unique in sight.  
For it is a reminder, that it's okay to be different too,  
And that in this world, there's a place for me and for you.",-1,-1

[this is pretty close](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/the-scene/bowie-a-golden-raccoon-is-winning-hearts-in-big-bear/2735135)

i didn't really think to take it but it was still in pretty amazing shape.  whatever hit it must have just barely got it.  no blood or anything...  i guess their pelts are worth quite a bit.  i went back after my dad had mentioned this and someone or something had taken it.",-1,-1

""What´s more, in many social species, odd-looking individuals are not accepted by their peers.
Researchers have observed shunned albinos among species as disparate as ravens, barn swallows and red-winged blackbirds. In studies of Adélie penguins in Antarctica, Jun Nishikawa of Japan´s Ocean Research Institute found that albino birds almost never find mates and are frequently pecked at by their peers. Because of such ostracism, the animals are less likely to reproduce and pass on their genes.""

And honestly its great, those people are jerks. They are just looking for something that its socially acceptable to hate on.

17676,"Dogs, what's the big deal? Everywhere I turn, I see people fawning over these four-legged pests. People treat them like they are royalty, constantly praising their loyalty, intelligence, and cuteness. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's all a big scam. 

Dogs are nothing but trouble. They bark at everything and anything, causing a commotion wherever they go. They jump on people, slobber all over everything, and never seem to tire of annoying everyone around them. And don't even get me started on their constant need for attention. It's like they can never get enough.

What's so special about dogs, anyway? They are not nearly as intelligent as cats, who are independent creatures that can take care of themselves. Dogs, on the other hand, are constantly seeking attention and approval from their owners. It's almost like they have no self-esteem.

And let's not forget about the messes they make. Dogs shed all over the place, leaving hair everywhere. They also like to dig holes in the yard, making it look like a war zone. And let's not forget about their ""accidents."" It's like they have no regard for personal property.

In conclusion, dogs are overrated. They are loud, messy, and always in need of attention. They are not nearly as intelligent or independent as cats, who are the true rulers of the pet world. So, let's give dogs a break and start giving some well-deserved attention to the true royalty of the pet world: cats.

Edit- no my parentheses wasn't sarcastic actually.

I know for a fact my cat does not only love me for food lmao, I wasn't his sole provider when he was adopted and he knew that. And he still chose to cuddle up on my sweaty armpits. Maybe it's because biologically he liked my scent, maybe it's because I kind of act like a Big Hairless Cat, maybe he could sense that I would give my entire life up for him without blinking. I don't care. You could do the same amount of thinking for Human Love and still end up at- I don't care why, it's just nice that they love me. *That* was the point of me comparing 'emotions' to 'biological drive'. They're basically the same imo, seeing as people who have PhDs in this crap still can't agree on where our cuddly lovey hormones come from lmfao",-1,-1

18092,"I split mine up into 3 categories: Entertaining, Educational, and Promotional; the amount of days you do each depends on your audience. From there, I look at any highly relevant holidays and anything the business is announcing, rolling out, or events. 

Other than that, I generally create content only 1-2 weeks in advance because the digital world is constantly changing and what is trending today won't be trending in a month.

18093,"As a social media manager, planning a monthly social media calendar is an important aspect of ensuring a consistent and effective online presence for a small business. My approach involves defining my goals, analyzing my audience, reviewing previous content performance, planning content themes, scheduling posts, and monitoring and adjusting the calendar as needed. 

To start, I identify the business goals and objectives I want to achieve through social media, understand my target audience and their preferences, and look at the engagement and reach of previous posts to determine what content performs best and what topics resonate with my audience. 

Based on these insights, I plan content themes for each month that include special events, promotions, holidays, etc. I then use a scheduling tool or calendar to plan and schedule my posts in advance, making sure to mix in different types of content such as text posts, photos, and videos. 

Finally, I regularly review and analyze the performance of my posts to identify any patterns and make adjustments to the calendar as needed.

18101,You may want to consider opening a new account and follow only those accounts that help you stay up to date with what's happening without any personal connections.,-1,-1
18102,You need to find things to do outside of work that will help you reset the day. Do you have any hobbies?,-1,-1
18103,"I might be able to offer some advice/perspective here. I've worked in social media... pretty much since there were social media jobs (so...what... 2007/8-ish?). I'm in my 40s, and have worked for lots of businesses in lots of sectors over the years (for the record, I'm higher up the career ladder now than then, but yep, still have to spend time on various social platforms, keep up to date with trends and functionality and so on).   


A couple of people have mentioned starting new accounts. This is definitely key. You can cross the streams a bit depending on which type of business you work for (the targeted ads I get are completely mental now because of industry changes over the years, IG doesn't know what to make of me), but keep a pro and a 'home' profile. I have several accounts on different platforms, mainly so I can try out new things without looking like a weirdo on my usual account).   


If you don't want to interact with social content outside of work, then don't. Get info by reading trends reports and blog posts, the advertising press etc. or going to conferences.   


While always being on social can occasionally help you spot trends or memes early, as you progress in your career, it's far more useful to be able to think about those trends strategically. Look for movements in the way people communicate, and where, rather than what they actually say day-to-day. If trends are key, then get Google alerts or a social listening tool set up and have it send you emails about unusual phrase volume rather than hunting it out yourself.   


When I started out, I would spend HOURS each day on social (mainly Twitter back then), wake up in the middle of the night and check my phone and so on. Even then, you will ALWAYS have blind spots - there's just too much happening in the world to see it all. It's not like I know what's happening on VALO or VKontakt right now, and I don't need to, if you were set up on a platform like that for work you'd need local people to help run it/create messaging/respond. 

&#x200B;

You can be better at your job by monitoring work-related streams during work hours, seeing how your customers and prospects speak, and using that as a basis for your activity.   


There's a good quote from Stephen Covey  I like to remember at work: ""The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing"". You aren't paid to be on TikTok 24/7. You're paid to be a content expert with technical expertise in certain platforms. That will actually help with business - a lot of companies fall into the trap of thinking they have to be relentlessly posting stuff, but honestly, most of them really, really don't. Social media can be a black hole, so it's fine to make sure you don't fall in.",-1,-1
18104,Stop being trend follower. Read magazines relative to advertising and tech. Focus on music lyrics for word play and caption inspo. Read books for languages and grammar structure. Don’t be afraid to think outside the box. Take risks with your content ideas. Not all will be home runs but you will be happier in the curation process. Might even have a light bulb moment or two.,-1,-1
18105,"It’s probably easier said than done and I still struggle with this as well.

I would say give yourself blocks of times where you can freely consume any form of social media. If you have free time during work, that can be one of your moments.

I know you’ll get the feeling of falling behind, missing out on a trend, missing some crucial pop culture reference but at the end of the day you also have to evaluate how well these things will actually transfer over to your work. Also, if a trend sticks around you’ll have plenty of time to see it and work it into your job somehow. Don’t stress out too much over it affecting your job.

That aside, I can say from my own experience Twitter has caused me the most stress. If I don’t need to go on it outside of work, I stay as far away as possible. The comment sections of any platform comes in 2nd, so I usually avoid those as well (when I’m not working). When consuming social media during your free time (outside of work related tasks), I would try and look for content that aligns with your hobbies/interests. Probably also turn those notifications off. 

Again, easier said than done but I’m sure you’ll figure out the perfect way to balance everything :). I’m sure we’ve all suffered through this at some point… or still currently haha.",-1,-1

1. Block dedicated time in you day (I've tried 30 minutes, but pick an amount of time that suits your needs) to  spend time on the various apps. When the time is up put the phone down.

2. Use app timers to ensure you're spending a reasonable amount of time on FB, IG, TikTok, etc.",-1,-1

18115,"I also work a social media marketing job and I feel this. The most helpful things for me was making a separate account that I only use for work, and then I downloaded a social media app blocker that I used during off-work hours to avoid mindless scrolling.",-1,-1
18116,"You should consider the possibility that you need to find a job that isn't focused on social media.  ""If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out.""  Jobs are important, but one that is putting you in a downward spiral is taking away something more important than what it gives back.    


Otherwise, you should analyze what exactly makes you unhappy when you're on social media.    A lot of people feel inadequate next to their peers' apparently perfect lives.  That's a feeling that you could address.  Ask yourself, Is there something in your history that makes you extra vulnerable to that?  If so, it needs to be dealt with even if you left social forever.  And you can address the issue almost everyone has with social which is that we know intellectually that what we see is not representative of our friends' lives (generally speaking) but on an emotional level we accept the facebook stream as a truth we then measure ourselves against.   Try training yourself into awareness of this on a level that will allow you to stop that from happening,    


Third option: stop doing a the job your bosses want you to do and focus instead on making your bosses believe you are doing what they want you to do.  The pressure is on you because they are too old to see what the trends are?  Then they lack the information to know the difference between a real trend you suss out from reviewing a million posts, versus one you make up while taking a bubble bath.  Most of what is written about trends is total bullshit, most trends are idiotic: what's the real difference in value for the client between that, and you picking a post you like and declaring it trend?  Unless they're using scientifically-collected data and rigorous statistical analysis (which no-one does), no one can prove that any of these declared trends actually exist.  The majority of them probably do not, or their reality (if it were known) is significantly different from how they are characterized.  Why not develop a system where you work on developing good marketing ideas largely ignoring social media, and then use limited time on the platforms to cherry-pick examples to show that what you propose to do is a ""trend"". I guarantee you, you would not be the first person to take this approach.  You could drastically cut your social media time and your bosses won't know the difference.",-1,-1
18117,"I second this! 7 years in the industry now, and my personal account is a graveyard. 

Just keep a ""test account"" to follow brands that are great at social and other interesting accounts. You can even use it to test our your posts to make sure they show up properly/aren't cropped etc before scheduling on the main brand account. 

The head of social/digital that I work with does the same thing. It's a running joke in the agency that the two of us (team leads for social) are ironically the two people who have zero personal social media presence.

I monitor trends via newsletters (Matt Navarra, Axios Marketing, Nicole Tabak, Morning Brew's Jack Appleby etc.) it's great because it's aggregating the trends and news for you, and then I have dummy accounts toggle between 1) I have one for peers and competitors morning 2) one for industry insights and 3) one for people or brands whose content I admire and want to leverage at my own organization.

3. Brandwatch is also good they are a little but pricey but the tool will help you with more than social listening. 
4. For Twitter there are tools like Testimonial (io) and Senja (io) promoted as social proof tools but they are doing the same work as social listening tools. So, you can use them too.

I can recommend the online activity tracker Snoopreport. However, it works exclusively for Instagram and this is its main disadvantage. With it, you can add up to 100 users with a public profile to the tracking and receive weekly reports about their hashtags, likes, follows and interests. Depending on the tasks, I track the activity of my current followers or competitors' followers. I use the obtained data to compile a content strategy, select local hashtags, analyze the audience of bloggers for cooperation, and so on.

18134,"I used metricool because it was all the rage and a bunch of SMM were pushing it pretty hard. As a data person, I was like yeah okay let’s try it.

Pros. It’s pretty user friendly (there’s some clunky bits but it’s not terrible) and it does support quite a few platforms, it’s … affordable ish.

Cons. Analytics are totally and completely inconsistent, for me this is is a HARD PASS (same thing reason why I hate Sprinklr but I dislike Sprinklr more than Metricool). Customer support (in my experience) was pretty unreliable in how the product works and how their API works with social media platforms. I have also heard absolute horror stories about their ad issues (but I never used that so I don’t know for sure).

These types of problems usually happen when a platform/company tries to do too much and scale too fast. I know of people who like the platform for the most part, however, no one in the industry with a sizeable amount of clients recommends it.

18190,Do you mean strategy or like a content schedule?,-1,-1
18191,"Here are a few tips that I've found helpful when creating a plan:

  
1. Set Goals: Before you start creating your plan, it's important to set goals for what you want to achieve with your social media presence. This will help you focus your efforts and measure your success.

  
2. Research Your Audience: Knowing who your target audience is will help you create content that resonates with them. Researching their interests, needs, and preferences will help you create content that is tailored to them.

  
3. Choose Platforms: Once you know who your target audience is, you can decide which platforms are best for reaching them. Different platforms have different strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to choose the ones that are best suited for your goals.  For example, if you're looking to share visual content, Instagram and Pinterest are great options. If you're looking to share more text-based content, Twitter and LinkedIn are great options.

  
4. Paid advertisements: it can be a great way to get your message out to a larger audience. However, it is important to consider your budget and the type of audience you are trying to reach before investing in paid advertisements. There are also many agencies on Instagram such as Ascend viral that can help to get the targeted audience. 

  
5. Create Content: Now that you know who your audience is and which platforms you'll be using, you can start creating content. Think about what type of content your audience will find interesting and engaging.",-1,-1
18192,I guess that's where my confusion is. I want to focus on strategy. I've been making content blindly.,-1,-1
18193,"Well you need both. 
Strategy in short: 
You have business goals that you transcribe into social media goals. (E.g.: increase brand awareness = reach) 
You look at your target audience which determines the platforms you should post on. 
You look at those platforms and find the algorithmic Zeitgeist. What works on the platform, is it galleries, engagement driven posts, video content, etc. (spoiler: most likely it is short form, vertical videos). 

Now you know who, where and what your goals are. Now let’s figure out how. 

Content strategy: 
Any brand needs to stick out. You are one swipe away from insignificance. 
A tip of mine is always the rule of 5S: 
- simple (one KPI per post as a rule of thumb, easy to understand messages, don’t be over complicated) 
- stringent (don’t flip flop ideas but be consistent with your formats for a while to get a qualitative and quantitative analysis)
- sustainable (don’t think of Formats that hinder you in production or cost too much time for little results) 
- strategic (post when you have something to say and it ticks all your strategy boxes) 
- shareable (content has to 1: reflect users point of view 2: help users express themself 3: users identify someone they know)",-1,-1

I’d write for lawn care businesses, limo rental companies, childcare facilities, car detailing companies, luxury flower subscriptions, or literally just whatever else was put on my plate that day. It was true then and now that the client always gets to see any and all content before it’s scheduled. The expert gets final approval without having to do the work themselves. Now, I operate as a freelancer, and the clients I have are people and businesses who personally trust me to help them achieve their social media goals. Nobody expects me to be an expert in their field, but they trust me to provide informative, fun, and relevant content while also, and way more importantly, handling everything else that comes with social media management. None of my clients care if I write the words that make up a post or if AI does, as long as what’s being posted fits their brand messaging and aligns with the goals of their company.

First, you need to find influencers in the niche you are interested in, so you can access similar profiles, since they will probably subscribe to them or even have publications with tags.

 Next, you need to study the audience of the profiles you are interested in and also search through their signatures. That is, in this way you will be able to use the snowball method to find various accounts in the niche you are interested in.

When it comes to the actual video content, TT is all about authenticity so bloopers may be more welcome, Instagram I’d grab a piece with a more defined hook, and and YouTube shorts I’d keep on the more informational style.

For Reels, I would focus on creating a video that is visually appealing, with a strong narrative and a unique style. For Shorts, I would focus on creating a video that is short and to the point, with a clear message and a strong call to action.

Personally, I don’t focus just on the approach but I also focus on how to promote each video on each platform. When it comes to promoting the videos, I would focus on using the appropriate hashtags and keywords for each platform. For Tiktok, I would use popular hashtags and trends to reach a wider audience. 

For Reels, I would use creative hashtags and keywords to attract the right viewers. Lately I hire a growth service on instagram called Ascend viral to help me to get the right audience organically and I found it amazing. Anyways, for Shorts I would use keywords that are related to the content of the video. Additionally, I would also use influencers and other social media platforms to promote the videos.",-1,-1

I just ask because I feel like recording the mistakes per say might be difficult without talking in the moment kinda thing whereas talking throughout the exercise would be easier to explain in detail and actually show those mistakes.

Since you’re focusing on TikTok, you have to hook your viewers almost immediately. Otherwise they’ll just scroll past your content.

Make your account attractive. Use themes, or set a particular tone for your feed. Use a username and name that is easily searchable.Write a good and informative bio. 

Engage with more people and follow small accounts in your niche. It is very important to find people in your niche so they will watch your videos and you will gain more followers. If you can't find them, you can find a marketing agency that provides this kind of services like ascend viral. I have seen people recommending them but check them to know more about it.

18469,"There’s an entire underground marketplace devoted to buying, selling or swapping unique and generic usernames. The most common way of obtaining them is by utilizing a media partner but most Meta reps will not entertain claims for anything generic that you can’t issue a trademark for. Our rep is only capable of processing claims for usernames that are at least six characters long, non-generic and have been inactive for at least a year or more.

The ones that are capable of claiming generics are usually corrupt and charge a ridiculous price tag in order to process the claim. Those with access to such reps end up reselling the handles to the highest bidder. Usually accounts like that must still be inactive though. If they’re not inactive, then it’s practically impossible to claim it regardless of which route you take.

Last I heard, @drip on Instagram got sold for a whopping $75k. Some generic handles are actively listed for sale across various Tele channels like @malicious ($15k), @administrator ($9k), @scanner ($2.2k) and hundreds of others. Even handles that are just random, short combinations of letters such as @teu, @igs, @jre are being sold for close to $6k in value so it’s definitely a lucrative field to be in despite being very obscure.

18470,"The rabbit hole gets weird with this.

Sometimes Instagram will say ""This username isn't available. Please try another""

and it will also say ""a user with that username already exist"".

Makes you wonder if they programmed their input system to block one-word dictionary usernames from being registered, so they can have it for themselves.

*^(Conspiracy music intensifies.)*",-1,-1
18471,Go and register them back in 2010 is all I can think of.,-1,-1
18472,"Well. Now that we have something called Username claim, if the name you’re willing to use has already been used by another users and they are inactive for atleast six months ago, I can help you claim the username but if otherwise you can just DM them and negotiate if they are willing to sell it.",-1,-1
18473,For many platforms you need a valid trademark to even begin the process.,-1,-1
18474,"You DM them and make them a price. When social media began to really catch on, smart users speculated on @ handles much like people speculate on URLs. Some won’t sell. Some will try and hold your feet to the fire. There’s no formal process or exchange. You just barter.",-1,-1
18475,Fascinating!,-1,-1
18476,"The username isn’t available error just means that the account that last had it is currently banned or de-activated. After about a year or so, the existence of the account ID is wiped entirely from their servers (i.e. perma-ban) and the username will become available again. However, if it’s a desirable handle, you have to be prepared for that to happen as they’ll get swept quickly as soon as they’re available again.

In fact, there are some very powerful private bots out there who scour every generic username practically every couple seconds to detect availability. That is why swapping services exist. To ensure that if you’re undergoing a username change and switching to a highly valuable handle, some automated tool does not steal it right out from under you as soon as the holder releases it from their account.

18486,"You’ve been slapped with the “viral curse” friend. You go viral, this brings in a shit ton of low quality followers. By low quality I mean people who will tap follow on everything they like meaning they follow so many accounts they don’t/can’t see them all and thusly don’t interact with them. 
The algorithm then farms out your new post to a small selection of these new low quality followers, they don’t interact with it because they just don’t see it, the algorithm then decides your post isn’t interesting and ceases pushing it to the wider audience. 

Just keep pushing on. I find Tiktok is the most dramatic and sporadic when it comes to post result consistency. Instagram tends to be more reliable with numbers but going super viral on there is far rarer.",-1,-1

Had a video hit 10k in like 15 minutes and then they slammed the brakes. Had a video hit 30K in an hour, same thing. 

Literally the worst of the platforms.",-1,-1

18490,"This is really interesting. There are a few things you could do next. If the like and comment ratio was good on the viral post, you can find a comment that has lots of likes (over 300 if possible) and make a video response. This should guarantee you over 2000 views as those who liked the video and the comment will most likely enjoy the response.  

If your video got 200K views but less than 7K engagements, I wouldn't consider this a viral post. it means your content got served to a lot of people and they may have spent time with it but didn't find their time well spent. IE. like, comment or share. 

Tiktok algorithm will serve your content to 10 people, then 100, then 1000, then 10 000, etc. People engaging with your content in the early stages help it be pushed further.  It may be that your new content isn't ""hitting"" the same viral audience. this is where trending sounds, well-known formats, and internet language come in.",-1,-1

18497,"*Just want to preface this with, this is just my speculation. Idk how TikTok’s algorithm actually works. 

I think this might be the case where the viral video worked against your account. That video brought in a ton of views/engagement/retention to the point that it screwed with your account. If the following videos didn’t perform as well as that viral video did within those certain “milestones”, TikTok will probably categorize it under something like “this video won’t catch these viewers attention”. 

Someone mentioned here that you’ll probably have to start making video replies to certain comments, just to get your account to a more stable/realistic numbers again.",-1,-1

Work with foodie influencers. Repost their content on your page. 

Some video ideas I can think of: 
-What's new on the menu
-Our top 5 most popular dishes 
-Everything I ate for dinner at X 
-Watch me chow down x 
-My boo and I visited this new restaurant
-What our Chefs eat in the restaurant
-Share a simple recipe",-1,-1
18505,"Facebook, just put your menu and hours up and that alone will go a long way. Photos of your food. Great looking photos of your food will go further. You could probably hire someone to do it. I’m sure ads when you’re in a slump could go a long way too. Facebook is a bit of a pay to play game now a days.

Google for sure, make sure you’re getting high results in search results. ad sense may be a good route too if you want to start getting the established presence. 

Instagram could be a good route too. Especially if you get good photos done. Brag about success, highlight some reviews from various places etc. stories are easy to disturb to different platforms like TikTok and Faceboook, but make sure the content is interesting or you’re just wasting time. 

Twitter for daily specials and everything above

Reddit could work based of your location. 

Keep track of Yelp, it’s a good resource for direct review, but make sure to answer positively or not at all. Keep track of any repeating negative reviews.

I’m sure there’s more, but I’m not sure what your budget is, where you are located, what your competition is, what kind of food you serve, and your overall goal. It may just be worth it to hire a social media person if you can afford to contract them out. Keep in mind none of this will help if you’re food isn’t up to snuff.",-1,-1
18506,Try Nextdoor,-1,-1
18507,"Only you can answer which social media is best suited for your restaurant by studying the niche, direct and indirect competitors, drawing up a portrait of your target audience and studying their behavior patterns. Do not skip this step, as it is really fundamental and will allow you to create a content strategy and attract customers in the future. 

As for content and promotion, I advise you to focus on one key factor. Since you are promoting an offline business, you need to focus on local promotion. To do this, again, it is necessary to study the audience of similar places very well, as well as correctly select hashtags to promote through the local audience. If we are talking about Instagram, then I can advise the online activity tracker Snoopreport. With it, you can add any users with a public profile to the tracking and receive weekly reports on their hashtags, follows, likes and interests. I can't recommend similar experiments for other social networks, since I work exclusively on Instagram, but in general you can focus on this data. They will allow you to create your own engaging content strategy, pick up niche hashtags, attract new customers, and in general get valuable insights about the behavior of your target audience. 

Good luck!",-1,-1
18508,"Congrats on opening your dream restaurant! That's amazing. I want to come eat there just by the way you called it your dream.

Doing social media for a business is a struggle. It takes a lot of energy to get the desired effect. I suggest considering hiring professionals for a ferry months to get it started and then you can continue that momentum they get going for you. Copy their tactics that work.

If you don't want to look at popular similar businesses and copy their tactics.

Stay consistent. Have a voice.

You sound passionate. If you're in front of the camera and people connect with you then you'll do better than just food photos. If you can make it funny the better.

18517,"Hi! Verification standards and processes vary by network - Meta has continued to consistently verify our journalists, Twitter’s a mess right now, TikTok will verify our brands but not our journalists. That said, prior to Elon’s Twitter takeover and TikTok’s diplomatic issues, most social networks would verify accounts that clearly represented people who were…

• Public figures

• Noteworthy

• Established platform users

To the last point, most networks won’t verify new accounts. Meta’s Instagram used to be most challenging: we coached our journalists to post three work-related photos or videos to their feed - not Story - every week for three months before they submit. 

To the former two points, know that your verification request may be reviewed by a system or person who is not from your country or familiar with its journalism customs or culture. They also may not see a record of your content that expires, like Stories. So when someone looks at your account, they should be able to tell immediately that you are a public, noteworthy person and that verifying you would benefit their users. Keep your bios simple - just say you’re a journalist and only link to reputable, known news orgs. I work in TV, and we coach our journalists not to use terms like anchor or host in bios, as they are not universal. And post public content related to your reporting that shows you’re a figure in the public interest. If verification is your goal, worry less about engagement and more about proving the network should verify you. 

Last tip: chat with the sites you work for and see if they have contacts and resources to assist. 

Best of luck!",-1,-1

so now home feed reflects more 50:50 as they still are promoting videos but still supporting photos

2. Make reels that not only adds value to your target audience but also entertains them

3. Try collaborating with accounts in your niche & reach out to influencers who has the audience you want.

4. Post stories that makes your followers interact.",-1,-1
18752,"Creating a social media strategy when a platform like Instagram is on the decline can be challenging, but there are a few key steps that you can take to ensure that your brand continues to engage and connect with your audience.

First, it's important to understand which platforms are still growing and where your target audience is spending most of their time. You can use tools like Google Trends and Alexa to research which platforms are gaining popularity, and then create a content strategy that is tailored to these platforms.

Second, you need to create a content that is interesting, informative and engaging. This will help you to build a following and keep your audience engaged. Use a variety of content types such as videos, images, and text to make your content more visually appealing and shareable.

Third, you should focus on building relationships with your audience. This can be done by responding to comments, messages, and DMs promptly, and by creating a sense of community around your brand.

Finally, it's important to be consistent with your posting schedule, as well as with your branding and messaging. By following these steps, you'll be able to create a social media strategy that will allow you to continue to engage and connect with your audience, even if Instagram is on the decline.",-1,-1
18753,"The main problem of Instagram at the moment is that they change their algorithms too often because of this, users and content makers do not have time to adapt.

In fact, I have found a solution for myself - it is to focus on content and constantly update the strategy in accordance with the interests of my audience. For example, global hashtags used to work well, but now local niche ones bring much better reach.

The main mistake of many content creators is the lack of an analytical base in the form of direct and indirect competitors and, most importantly, the target audience. For some reason, many consciously or accidentally skip this step. Although now there are even a large number of auxiliary tools that make this process easier.

If we talk about Instagram, then I can advise the online activity tracker Snoopreport. With it, you can monitor likes, hashtags, follows and interests of any users with a public profile. Most often, I track my current followers or competitors' followers, but sometimes also some specific target audience, depending on the tasks. Such data allows you to get valuable insights and organically advance in Instagram.

Yes, now the numbers may not be as big as they were a year or two ago before the global updates. But nevertheless, such an organic method is still the most effective and fruitful in the long term.",-1,-1
18754,"
Here are a few suggestions for creating a social media strategy for Instagram:

1.Understand your audience: Who are your target customers, and where do they spend their time on Instagram? 

Understand their interests, pain points, and what type of content they're most likely to engage with.


2.Set clear goals: What do you want to achieve with your Instagram strategy? Increased brand awareness, more website traffic, or sales? 

Having clear goals in mind will help you stay focused and measure the success of your strategy.


3.Create a content calendar: Plan out your content in advance to ensure a consistent and cohesive brand message. 

This will help you to stay organized, save time, and avoid last-minute scrambling for content.


4.Use Instagram's features: Instagram is constantly updating its features and tools to help businesses engage with their audience. 

Features like Instagram Stories, IGTV, and Reels can be great ways to drive engagement and reach new audiences.


5.Measure and Optimize: Track your performance and engagement metrics, and use the data to optimize your strategy. 

Use insights and analytics to understand what's working and what's not, and adjust your strategy accordingly.


remember that social media strategy is not a one-time fix, it's an ongoing process that should be reviewed and updated regularly. It's also important to diversify your social media strategy and not to rely solely on one platform. As a social media specialist, it will be important to have a deep understanding of the different platforms, their strengths and weaknesses, and the target audience that each platform serves.",-1,-1

18759,"Its not dead its just gonna take some consistency. Here’s some ways you can up their social strategy organically

1) comment/like posts on influencers/top accounts in your niche 10 mins before posting. 
2) post every day for 60 days switching between static posts, carousel posts and reels. After 60 days, find what gets you the most engagement and build content pillars off of that. 
3) create engaging story posts. Think this or that niche-specific stories, Q+As, polls
4) spend about 10 mins a day watching reels to find trending sounds and save them. That way when you’re ready to post a reel you have a plethora to choose from. 
5) look at viral videos in your niche and scroll the comments for unanswered questions from users and use that to create content.

So... the good news is... that it's far from dead.

18774,"Been seeing a lot of tik tok ban discussions due to security concerns but does anyone else find it funny how America wants to monopolise on the user information market? So they have a grudge against Chinese applications. The reason countries like India banned tik tok is because that company is making less of an effort to create political echo chambers for governments to use as propaganda, usually you are exposed to a wide variety of viewpoints on tik tok. Unlike meta products where the content you see on those sites varies country to country. I went to Morocco and used tik tok and was exposed to Arabic LGBTQ discussions which is a massive no no in that country. Where as meta seemed to have censored that content for me whilst I was on holiday and I was shown the more conservative content instead.

The information tik tok collects is literally the same as what meta companies do. Infact the lawsuit against Facebook was one of the main reasons they changed their company name to meta, so that Instagram and WhatsApp is not associated with Facebook on the surface level for the less informed.

At the end of the day. All social media sites will eventually die that's why it's best to not put all your eggs in one basket and not give up on Instagram. As for strategy I'm seeing reels being used more commonly than people viewing actual posts so focus on that as a strategy and use those reels to create posts. With the marriage between Instagram and Facebook pages, it's worth making sure you are utilising Facebook links as well, as meta doesn't want Facebook to die off so they seem to favour linked posts.",-1,-1

2. Too many companies rely on TikTok financially. Even government organizations and entities advertise on TikTok and *have* TikTok accounts. 

3. TikTok being “banned left and right” in a handful of countries has more to do with politically-driven content concerns in third-world and war-torn countries than security concerns. The US is the only country vocal about TikTok as a security concern. European and many world leaders disagree (Europe’s concerns are more about antitrust and DSA, and the EU has said many times they won’t ban the platform).

4. In the past decade, Big Tech has faced more privacy concerns/criticisms and threats of getting shut down. You just hear about TikTok the most because it’s sensationalized, familiar and less boring. What Big Tech doesn’t have and TikTok has is millions of people who will fight the government if they come even close to banning TikTok as a country. If Big Tech hasn’t been shut down, what makes you think TikTok will?

Don’t panic. Just focus on the data. On small incremental improvements. Experiment with ads. Change up content. You can do it.

The only brands that are “reliant” on Tik Tok are brands with large followings on that one platform and no other platform. Anyone in that situation should absolutely be spending dollars and effort to grow on other platforms. 

Can’t wait to see the Tik Tok users of the US joining together to fight the good fight to keep their time waster from being banned when every platform is trying to mimic TT. They will bitch about it for about 20 seconds, get distracted by Reels or Shorts or Idea Pins and move on to another platform. 

Yes, big tech has faces many threats to being shut down. But has it occurred to you that big tech in this country might have a very solid financial interest in getting TT banned? They are all trying to mimic TT but their strategy has shifted to include getting the platform removed because if it does their pieces of the pie get soooo much bigger. And that is something Meta, Twitter, Pinterest and YouTube can all agree on. 

The lesson is not to put all your eggs in the Tik Tok basket. If it makes you money, keep doing so. But make sure you are growing audiences on other platforms at the same time. If Tik Tok is your only parachute be nervous and built out a spare chute(s) on other platforms.",-1,-1

If that’s all you have then it’s time to head back to the kids table so the adults can talk. Because if anyone thinks that only relying on Tik Tok for advertising is a good idea then you have a self serving vested interest in only that platform and your bias is obvious. If you think building up audiences on other platforms while making money on TT is a bad idea then you just have no business or marketing acumen.

The two leading contenders for the presidency both are in favor of banning Tik Tok. Sure Trump tried to do so with some compromise during his term, but that doesn’t mean he will do so if he gets a second term. And Florida just banned it for state employees.

Anyone who has ever used a government or company owned device don’t even use social on those devices unless it’s part of their job. Banning on government and company devices doesn’t make a difference with regards to usage. 

It’s also going to be incredibly difficult for Congress to ban TikTok or any social media platform on private phones. First, it has to show proof that banning TikTok will actually help. Second, there’s a strong argument that doing so is a violation of the First Amendment.

YouTube is not some free online college. Most of the ""information"" content that companies put out is to help prove why you should use them to perform the covered service. If they aren't trying to make money entertaining you, then they are trying to sell you something.

I will agree to a degree that there is a good deal of bs on YouTube. People can post anything they want (as long as it is compliant).

Social media platforms today are a mess, you need years of experience and you will sooner or later struggle with unexpected restrictions which will make you hate the platforms.

Also, its not fair to sell your services to customers if you do not know what you are doing. 
-Someone working in a SMM agency for several years now",-1,-1
18913,"I have been doing social media professionally since ~2007 or so. I've worked in house, at an agency, and now own a consulting agency. I also teach college level SMM, and grew up with two small business owning parents. There's three sides to your question: 

1- For SM skills: Make sure you have a good understanding of professional skills in strategy, reporting, paid SM, organic SM, crisis comms, PR, influencer relationships, and measuring both ROI and ROAS. You don't have to be an expert in everything, but you need to know enough to know when you're being BSed or when a client has unreasonable expectations. And you need to be able to clearly set reasonable expectations you know how to actually achieve.  

2- For owning a business: you need to spend some time setting yourself up for business success. (What follows assumes you're US based) Even if you plan on being a one person show / freelancer, you need to have a setup and plan for: 

Business structure (Sole prop? LLC? S-Corp? C-corp?) 

Accounting and taxes

Business plan for yourself, including a target audience, marketing plan, etc. 

Licenses-- EIN, state licenses, local licenses, any others required. 

Business insurance so you're protected if you make a mistake that costs your clients a lot of money. 

This isn't just a clever name and logo. This is the foundation work that will make or break most businesses, no matter the type. 

Again, you don't have to be an expert. But you should have thought about it, consulted with an accountant and / or tax professional, etc. Your local SCORE can likely help. 

3- For owning an *agency* specifically - know how you plan to hire, train, retain, compensate, and fire employees or contractors. Take a management class or two. And think about how you'll do your work. Do you want everyone to communicate via email? Slack? Discord?
Do you want W2 employees 1099 contractors? How about quoting -- will you do standard packages or customized quotes? Can your employees quote for you? How does that impact cash flow? Are you comfortable doing net 60? Or net 30? All of this impacts the day to day stuff behind doing the work. 

And finally -- some advice-- if you'll be *only* using those platforms you list, make that super clear to your clients. Not all clients are best served by those platforms, and as audiences shift, so do platforms. Partner with people who know other platforms or start learning ASAP and don't stop.  Professional SMM is *very* different from personal SMM. 

If you have never worked with a client, start by volunteering with a local nonprofit and learn some ropes first and make your worst mistakes before someone is paying you for them -- otherwise cleaning up those messes could cost you more than you make.",-1,-1

18916,"If what you listed is your experience in smm, you aren’t ready for an internship at my agency… 

The clients with viable budgets need you to know Wordpress, ad buys, YouTube/Vimeo, LinkedIn, and on FB, you need to get really granular and go beyond posting to a company page because the organic reach there is crap. 

Twitter is questionable but I still have a fair number of clients who want to be there (but we aren’t advertising right now). You will also need to know about alternative platforms like Pinterest, Reddit, Quora, and the upcoming platforms the bigger guys may copy features from. 

You will want to be an expert in content management systems and publishing software. I pay good money for software that allows me to easily crosspost content optimized for each platform. Nothing looks more unprofessional than seeing some clown show agency crosspost from Instagram to Facebook in a format that is obviously for Instagram (and the dot dot dot string of hashtags has been unprofessional for a while)… 

You need to know how to manage entity governance and admin settings on all of the platforms and that also can be a headache if you’re a new agency. 

You will also want professional liability insurance that covers marketing claims. You will need contracts with clients. 

I don’t touch graphic design beyond Canva, but I have partners who can handle graphic design, video production (it’s more than using your phone for TikTok), and PR. If you don’t have expertise in everything and want to go ahead, you will likely need to hire a lot of help. That will affect your prices and the kinds of clients you can go after, which can be challenging if your portfolio only consists of Instagram, TikTok, and FB.",-1,-1

As for Instagram, I couldn't even reach 1k followers, even after posting daily for about 3 months and posting the same videos that I post on Tiktok. So I went for a growth service to grow my account. I found an agency named ascend viral, and since they grow accounts organically with no bots, I went for them and they handled my account for few months until I reached a decent number of followers.

In the beginning especially, try to be consistent, and to offer people someting... Talk about t-shirts, the history of it, why do you like them, how are your T-shirts different... 

Also post engaging stories such as polls, asking people questions, telling them to repost something...

I only talked about instagram, but right now I think it's the best way to promote something (and also tiktok)... 

If you want easy traffic (extremely low conversion rate) post on tiktok, create 10 different videos involving your t shirts and constantly repost them... Trust me, a friend of mine did this with some kindles, and it was insane...

Using tiktok is a cheat code...

Then if tou want to scale it up even more, create an email list and from then it's up to you if you want to nurture it by hiring a copywriter, that wat you make sure that someone will be there to buy anytime you launch something new...

18979,"If you are going to become a music influencer, you need to develop a strategy and a suite of packages that you can offer those users who want that space on your account.

While you aren’t a massive influencer, you do fall in the micro-influencer range, which is becoming more popular with marketers because their audience is usually more engaged than users will millions of followers. But you also will not be able to offer the same prices that the Biebers of the world can.

I recommend looking around for some similar social media influencers that are not in the music world and ask them what their pricing structure is. You definitely should never charge less than $100. Hell, I’d probably start at $200 or $500 and throw in some extra elements like analytics reporting, a bigger package with multiple posts, or even a package that offers “the works” that would include you creating a short video promoting their music. 

You have a ton of opportunity here, it all depends on how much you want to dig in invest (time-wise) in becoming an influencer and content creator.

My Instagram page was getting down because of them until I found this agency called Ascend viral. They helped to to get real followers organically. That helped my page to to reach more people who interact with me and my content. So I think instead of wasting your time searching for the fake accounts, try to search for real ones.",-1,-1

19017,"Hey, hope you are doing well!

A. Your approach is right also but let me suggest something.

B. First, make a google sheet of Content Calendar 

1- Decide the dates. like on which dates you are going to post your content.

2- Decide which content you are uploading if it's an Image/Video.

3- Decide the caption for your content.

4- Post 2-3 pieces of content a week.

5- Decide the budget. (if you're running campaign ads)

6- Make a deadline for it like if you have done that content or not. 

Try to post some creative content, deals, or offers that attract your customer through your store.

C. I make the same Content Calendar for my clients as well.",-1,-1
19018,"You should definitely download an app like Preview! It connects to your Instagram and will load all of your current content from your feed. Then you can plan your new content in advance and see how it will visually look on your Instagram feed. You can also add your captions and hashtags as well! I typically write my captions a day in advance depending on my post. I’m a SMM for a brand and here is my strategy.

-Post 6 times a week on IG
2-3 Reels and 3-4 Static Post depending on the week 

-Post on all relevant food holidays to the brand 

-Have monthly photo shoots where I can then batch create all of my content/reels for the month. I typically can get enough content for a month or two from one shoot. 

-Hashtag Research: I use around 20 of the same researched hashtags on every post and then add around 5 new hashtags that are relevant to the post that day. 

-Repost all Reels/TikTok’s to Pinterest as Idea Pins

-TikTok is great to help you find your niche and see what current sounds and videos are trending. 

-ENGAGE with other accounts that are in your niche! Always respond to comments and DMS. 

-I always repost UGC stories that we are tagged in and interact with customers via DM.",-1,-1
19019,Excellent advice here. For content ideas…you could Google to look up hashtag holidays for 2023 and start making posts ahead. You’ll end up participating in your favorite themes with several on-brand posts this way. I used this strategy for IG but it could work well on other platforms.,-1,-1
19020,"Looks solid to me. Let us know how it goes, OP.",-1,-1
19021,"great advice. 

i've got a few more questions if you don't mind answering.

how long have you been implementing that strategy and what has been the growth using that strategy?

is the brand a single restaurant, chain, or food product?

what's your method for researching hashtags? 

what's the idea/reasoning to the pinterest idea pins?",-1,-1
19022,"I’ve been doing this strategy for about a year now and our Instagram account has gained around 4,000 followers and we have done multiple collabs with other big name food/beverage brands as well. I also started our TikTok account a year ago and we’ve gained 2,000 followers from scratch and I’ve have a video go viral with over 1.2 million views!

-The brand I work for has 4 local shop locations and we are also available Nationwide in Sprouts Farmers Market as well as a few local Whole Foods locations and other grocery stores. 

-I simply looked at other accounts in our niche and saw what hashtags they were doing and what worked best for them. Typically it’s best to use hashtags in the 1K-500k range so your content is more likely to get noticed when you search that hashtag. Any hashtags over a 1M are way too saturated. 

-Pinterest has been an awesome extra form of free marketing! It’s probably one of the best upcoming Social Media Apps. I simply just repost all of my video content from our Reels/TikToks and the engagement is great! Our account gets around 80K monthly views and we get great engagement as well as traffic to our website.",-1,-1

19024,I work for a dessert brand! So I post a lot of recipes and food content.

Start observing more content, and read the comments along with that. Observe what people are talking about, and what you can give in return. Plus, make sure you do good work on your copywriting. Try Copy.ai for a while to learn some copywriting styles. Lead generation is another thing.

19032,"Hi u/selma2095 I specialize in #PPCAds, but I think I can answer at least 1 of your questions.

1. A better formula might be to use ((Likes + Comments) / Total Impressions or Reach) x 100

This would consider the fact that not every single one of your followers may have seen your post. Shares are also included with your engagement rate.

2. Were all of your posts scheduled from Hootsuite? Every publishing platform doesn’t always track posts unless they’re made from the platform.

3. This is interesting. Perhaps, double check your date range or give Hootsuite 1-2 days to register recent posts if it is not up to date.

Hope this helps!",-1,-1
