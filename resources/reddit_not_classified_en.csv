3,"Interesting that all you see in the news, including Washington post and nytimes, is headlines about tech layoffs. Which is a thing but the lazer focus on negative headlines gives the impression that everything is going to shit.",-1,-1
4,"I remember my parents would clap back with ‚Äúmore people are working than ever before!‚Äù when I critisized Trump. 

Wonder if they‚Äôre as excited about Biden‚Äôs job numbers that blow Trump‚Äôs out of the water",-1,-1
5,"I likely have the job market Biden helped create to thank for my recent change in jobs.  8 months ago I was working at the same company I've been working for for 15 years getting underpaid for a job that kept having additional jobs rolled into it.  By the time I left, I was doing about 3 1/2 jobs.  They just kept eliminating positions and adding those responsibilities to my job with no additional pay.  

Now I'm working a job that pays 20k more, fully remote, amazing benefits, and a workload that feels like a never ending vacation to me in comparison.  Oh, and I just got promoted, got a raise, and a pretty nice bonus.  They're working hard to keep me happy because if I leave, they will now have a very hard time replacing me. 

That never would have happened if the job market hadn't shifted to the point that the employees actually have some power for a change.",-1,-1

I think it a case of not want to work for a shitbag operation that over expects and under compensates.

Low unemployment, higher pay, are meaningless if everything else goes through the roof. We need to figure out how to keep housing prices from spiking like they have been. At the same time I feel like we're going to have a ton of investors and home buyers that bought over the past few years end up underwater when things settle down. That home they bought for 40k over the already high asking price is going to end up worth $100k less if we're not careful.",-1,-1

54,"Now I just want to remind everyone, unemployment isn't a binary ""person A has or doesn't have a job"", but rather one person working 4 jobs to stay afloat and 3 homeless, unemployed people is also a 100% employment rate. 

When I hear how the majority in North America are living paycheck to paycheck, and I see homeless camps in every single city, I know what those numbers actually say. 

Employment stats should only show the percent of the population with at least one job, and a separate stat showing the average number of jobs people hold.  THAT would tell the story a lot more accurately than these feel-good reports.",-1,-1

91,I read that wrong at first.,-1,-1
92,Almost as if the American workforce is smaller.... Perhaps due to million surplus deaths over 3 years... Plus illnesses... Must be shark attacks.,-1,-1

106,I'm seeing IT laid off all over the place. Also if you've exhausted all your unemployment benefits you don't show up in these numbers. Then there's COVID that hit the country hard. A lot of people that lost their jobs are now joining workforce again.,-1,-1

140,And those unfuckable M & M's,-1,-1

143,"I keep telling people look at what each side is angry about to decide where you fall.

151,"It was on LinkedIn, so take it with a huge grain of salt, but someone posted a graph showing layoffs this past year versus the head count growth at those same companies the two years prior (all tech companies btw). The layoffs are just a tiny fraction of how many jobs were actually created the last few years. They‚Äôre more of a ‚Äúcorrection‚Äù by these companies that saw massive growth during/post COVID than a sign the economy is tanking.",-1,-1
152,"Thats because the 1% is trying hard to will a recession into reality so that workers dont get the leverage that comes with a tight labor market and a churning economy.

Make no mistake, the 24 hour coverage of the coming recession is propaganda trying to spook the economy into a recession. The people who decide what corporate mainstream media covers do NOT want a healthy economy right now since some serious labor gains have happened and might continue to happen.",-1,-1

There is a lot of media attention on tech layoffs but at the end of the day any of those people can go find new jobs easily as long as they are actually skilled.",-1,-1

157,"Maybe

Unemployment is not the same as Underemployment (not measured), wherein People are working but not able to support themselves on their income.

Underemployment is just as important in the determination of the state of the economy but is seldom promoted, because the switch to ""Gig Economies"" has greatly increased this number.

159,"The 516k is the establishment survey.  Which should be noted has a ton of fuckery going with it.  It should be a smoothed graph, so when things like this crop up, you need to ask why.  The preceding four months all show a consistent downtrend, combine that with December (q4) sales are down across the board, ISM manufacturing data has fallen off a cliff (stuff like new orders) and the yield curve is more inverted than it has ever been.

This is especially true as the secondary part of the data set (which MSM, government aren't talking about) is the household survey, which shows only 84k new jobs.

That is a huge disparity when normally they are fairly close together.

That said, it's a bit of a psychological play by the government.  If people think the economy is going to shit, they won't spend as much, if they think it's doing great, they will spend more.

There of course is only one problem with that, people don't have more money to spend.  Every time the Fed raises rates, CC minimum payments go up, car loan payments go up, mortgages go up, the amount of refis goes down (which could be used as a source of liquidity by consumers). and inflation hasn't come down so much that it's freeing up enough to match.

The government isn't going to tell you things are falling off a cliff until well after you're mid air.",-1,-1

They don't see the connections. They don't see how the their situation was the beginning of the time where most families need both parents working and how that leads to more people working than ever before. They see the more people working than ever before as a positive, not the slow drain on the middle and lower classes to prop up the billionaires.",-1,-1
163,"I'm not excited about either, because the pay still largely sucks.

It's a little better now because labor has flexed its muscle slightly, but the fed is doing everything it can to shit on labor to ""cool inflation"" when they should be taxing corporate windfall profits instead.

People need to keep organizing, keep forming/joining unions, keep leaving shit jobs, and keep demanding work from home if they want it and it works better for them/their work can be done from home.

But unemployment numbers are a smokescreen. They often ignore those who just stopped asking for unemployment, and ignore all the jobs that are poverty wage dogshit.

Biden ain't Trump so I'm not trying to do some both sides bs. I'm just saying our economy is not doing as well as they want to pretend it is. The working class is still getting F'd.

Biden gets some mild credit for being sort of pro union when it's easy, but loses a lot for stopping strikes once it becomes hard, too.",-1,-1

Same with how they refuse to admit that in the 3 years before COVID, GDP actually grew less than Obama‚Äôs final years in office.

The truth is that Trump‚Äôs pre-COVID economic numbers were pretty meh and continued the economic course he inherited. The claim that Republicans are somehow better for the economy is a flat out lie.",-1,-1

Left a job where I was super underpaid, super overworked, for a fully remote job that pays double my old salary, tons of appreciation from my team and leadership, and the workload feels like a cakewalk.

They have all but admitted in the past their goal was to create ""uncertainty"" so that workers could not feel safe to quit and look for better opportunities.

So many restaurants/bars/retail etc are closing brick and mortar or doing drive thru/delivery only.   If everyone is working, why is there such a staffing issue?   And it‚Äôs not just wages.

A bunch of these restaurants have waiters making over $20/hr but cannot get anyone to even apply.

Which as you can guess ended predictably.

>The Statute of Labourers (and its counterpart, the Ordinance of Labourers) was, of course, **very unpopular with the peasants, who wanted higher wages and better living standards, and was a contributing factor to subsequent peasant revolts**, most notably the English peasants' revolt of 1381. Similar processes happened throughout Europe ‚Äì wage caps following a labour shortage after the Black Death resulting in popular revolts.

Don't let them get away with saying Disney had special privileges; nearly every retirement development in Florida has those exact same privileges.

Also, this is going to stick Florida with a $2B municipal bond Disney took out to build roads. As well as making central Florida taxpayers responsible for the upkeep of all the infrastructure Disney handled, including transition costs and hiring new personnel.

Tons of convention business goes down there because of how much the Orlando area can support, as a result of the mouse. Sure, there are beaches and whatever, but Disney put this state over the top. 

I would like to think that Disney would call his bluff and start work to relocate the park as a result.

The third one may be the stickiest: in the US, that means well below the Mason-Dixon Line, and probably farther south than that (Disney was planning on building a history-themed park near Manassas until locals got it shut down), which in reality that means TX, OK, AR, LS, MS, AL, FL, GA, SC, *maybe* TN, *maybe* MO. Those are all states who, while they could use the tourist revenue, are on the same extreme political end as FL‚Äôs current administration, and I can‚Äôt see Disney risking that much of any potential investment without a completely ironclad agreement with that state‚Äôs legislature; they thought they had that with Reedy Creek, and even that has been called into question.

1508,"How I fucking wish ""Kids in cages"" never became the misleading rallying cry against Trump when ***kidnapped children*** was the more accurate description of what the administration was doing that needed to be stopped immediately.

How many times have you seen some galaxy brain talk about how ""Oh nobody says 'kids in cages' anymore now that it's ok Biden is doing it!"" Yeah it was a stupid and inaccurate criticism to begin with, because any kind of policy of detaining people caught trying to cross the border illegally will fit the ""kids in cages"" meme. 

The entire reason people got mad at Trump beyond the border wall nonsense was because he specifically ordered a family separation policy that was designed to function as a cruel deterrent to immigration. The Obama administration was forced to adopt a family separation policy because courts ruled that minors could not be detained with adults when detained by ICE, but the Trump administration embraced this policy and added on kidnapping and forced separation *across the country* which resembled human trafficking more than any kind of immigration policy.

And yeah, Biden is reuniting people while still maintaining a policy of not letting anyone cross the border anywhere at any time for any reason. We can talk about the ethics of detaining people caught trying to cross a national border illegally, and we should. But its an entirely separate discussion from whether one should steal their kids and ship them across the country and throw away the records of where they went.",-1,-1

That's obviously an extreme example, but it's not dissimilar to Trump purposefully breaking up families and not even trying to put them back together.

(This was important because there were many places in America where the use of Indian Languages remained *illegal.*) It also gave tribes the right to use their languages on official documents and within their own schools. Prior to NALA they were required to use English.  NALA also meant an end to the forced adoption of the English language for Indian children. **1990**. Not 1890. Not even 1969. 1990. That was when Congress officially guaranteed the right of Native Americans to use our languages.


What does this have to do with the Tuskegee Experiments and the illegal separation of immigrant children? I'm sure you've heard of the cruelty and brutality of the Native American boarding schools,  but you may be under the assumption, like most people, that they were ended in the 19th century.  But sadly that's not the case. They continued through the 60's, the 70's, and even the 80's. Sure,  there were token reforms every so often,  less kids died and conditions improved, but they continued. In 1973 60,000 American Indian kids were in boarding schools. 60,000 kids forcibly separated from their families,  beaten, starved,  treated badly.  Millions over the years. It was horrible. Yet, when you needed to think of a national tragedy to compare to the separation of immigrant children from their parents,  you reached for the Tuskegee Experiments.


This isn't some slight against you,  or some asshole attempt to call you out, or paint you as a racist or anything terrible. Instead,  it's a reality check. That's the truth of America's cruelty.

2054,""".... like all such treaties ratified by the Senate, is part of the binding law of the United States.""

This is NOT always true as a general statement.  The Constitution is clear that it can be amended only after ratification by states, etc.  Even if ratified by the Senate, courts will not enforce an unconstitutional treaty.  

I see a few potential legal hurdles supports will need to address.  

For clarity, this article talks only about a *non-voting* delegate.  That may be Constitutional, idk.  

Some comments are confusing with a regular, voting Congressman.  Under today's laws, a fully voting member for the Cherokee would conflict with the Constitution's one-person, one-vote principle *unless* the Cherokee also agreed to stop voting for the state's other congressional candidates.

When the treat was signed, Cherokee had zero say in US legislation since they generally were not considered citizens.  Decades after the treaty was signed, the US passed the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 allowing Native Americans the vote in federal elections, including for Congress.  In reviewing the treatise's Article 7 current enforceability, a court may review whether the purpose (of giving Cherokee representation in Congress) *already* has been fulfilled since, like you and me, they can vote for Congressmen.  

Another potential legal hurdle is whether and which Cherokee legally authorized the treaty.  It was hugely unpopular amongst regular Cherokee at the time, primarily for cessation of land in exchange for payment of $5,000,000, assumption of debts, and other incentives.   Many Cherokee immediately claimed that their purported representatives were not authorized to bind them on their behalf.  I'm sure historians can shed more light on the factual details than I can.",-1,-1

That's a different conversation, one that should probably also happen. Should indigenous people have more voice in Congress than other US citizens? That's a moral argument.

Of all of the tribes, only a few actually pay a regular profit sharing dividend. The rest are given access to tribal amenities and aid. Most of the larger tribal members are of majority white heritage since their is no percentage requirement- if you have one drop you can join. This means that the majority of people in certain states will be tribal members within 2-3 generations and eventually, almost everyone in America will be eligible.

2235,"I don't like the ""genetic"" reasoning for many reasons.  I mean, should we go in every nursery and yell at babies for what their great-great-great-great grandparents did, or should we wait until they're teenagers?  /S

But, if we were to play the genetics game, I'll note this: 

- most federally recognized tribes formally allow and currently have many members with significant non- indigenous genes. 

- millions of ""white"" and ""black"" Americans have indigenous genes from ancestors 150+/- years ago.

- As you note, many millions of Americans came to the US after the western frontier had closed.  Irish, Polish and Czech immigrants in the early 20th century had nothing to do with Andrew Jackson's ""Indian"" policy.

- Millions of more American came here more recently as refugees.   Should we blame the white Ukrainian family moving to New Mexico for taking stolen land? Should we blame their grandchildren?

- Millions of 17th and 18th century Americans came here to escape political oppression, torture and war.  They were refugees too.  Puritans and Huguenots were tortured in Europe.  Many Virginia planters were supporters of Charles I who had to flee after his execution.  Should we blame their grandchildren? 

- There were white Americans who worked hard in the 18th and 19th century for better treatment of indigenous groups.  The treaty discussed in this article passed the Senate by ONE VOTE. Hugely controversial. How is blaming everyone then different from 100 years from now blaming some Antifa for Trump's policies.  

- finally, no one is genetically pure.  Most of us have a mix of good and bad and forgotten ancestors.   You do not have DNA from all of them.   Go back 10 generations.  That's about 1000 people.  You likely have DNA from only about 100 of them since DNA is not evenly divided in each generation.   It generally travels in clumps (chromosomes). You don't have every chromosome that your grandp had.  

- DNA is not destiny.  Identical twins are different.   Nurture but also epigenetics.",-1,-1
2236,"The upper house of the UK, the House of Lords, like the Crown, has had it powers transfer to the lower house, the House of Commons, over many years. Today the House of Lords is more of an advisory body and reviews and debates proposed legislation coming from lower house. What bills they can actually block is very limited. Its members are appointed and mostly, maybe all?, are nobility.

Ironically, Senators being elected is a recent development (1913). They were originally appointed by state legislatures which makes sense when you think about original purpose of the Senate to act as an opposing body to lower house. The difference is the power of the House of Lords has devolved over time while arguably the Senate has accumulated more power (judicial appointments becoming more and more partisan) and by design acts as a check against that ""commoner mob"" (i.e. the popularly elected House of Representatives).

What I'm arguing for is to reduce the power of the Senate. It's design is absolutely obsolete, and it is by its design anti-democratic. They could still be popularly elected, but let's be honest, they're acting in the interest of the state as intended not in the interests of a state's or the country's people. This is what's so very frustrating about the 60-vote filibuster, a very recent development (1975). A body that's intended to slow and check the will of the people is made even less democratic by the 60-vote filibuster.

In addition to uncapping the lower house to provide better representation, the federal government would become much more representative. For one, gerrymandering gets harder, house elections become much more local, special interests will have a much harder time trying to corral \~3000+ representatives, and a two-party system will also likely be much harder to enforce.

Our constitution explicitly recognizes Indigenous Tribes as soverign nations. Bc of this, Native Americans weren't automatically entitled to citizenship until Congress passed a law in 1924 (Many had it bc of the 1887 dawes act, but there were requirements and it wasn't universal).

Questions of tribal rights and autonomy should be dealt with as a matter of engaging with dependent, autonomous nations, not as a matter of racial relations within the United States' legal framework.

It gets extra confusing/stupid because Indigenous/Native American is an acknowledged race in the United States, and legal questions involving violations of civil rights do apply when the race of a person affects their treatment by the United States government.

Yeah but also they aren't working it out themselves so what you think isn't aligning with the reality of the situation. 

The reality of the situation is that this whole situation exists because indigenous people were denied agency by colonizers. The situation can only be rectified by restoring that agency.

Give seats to all three. Heck, give three seats to every indigenous tribe in the US. Let them take every seat of congress.

This is what will happen with this idiotic situation too. But when something is being done at the state level, and the state won't just back down with threats of lawsuits, then it actually goes to the Courts. That is always going to be a very slow process though. 

Usually political pressure corrects these errors faster, but DeSantis won overwhelmingly even though it was clear he'd keep doing stuff like this.

Now, should the venue be punished? Of course not. This is the state retaliating because parent's apparently aren't responsible enough to read the multiple warnings about the show not being suitable for young children.

The demographics are against them and 2016 was the last chance they had. Each election from here on out gets more difficult for them. They threw everything they had into 2018, 2020, and 2022 and all three were historically bad for them. The next few years are going to be extremely ugly but I think Trump losing in 2020 signaled that they would not and will not fully succeed.

Especially with other states also all racing to pass similar fascist shit, republicans now being upfront how they intend to force shit like abortion bans nationwide, and Trump vowing to do all these same things nationwide if he gets reelected I think it‚Äôs clear that none of them have any plans to keep this shit in their own states only. The whole point of it all is to force their will upon everyone else. This is part of a larger, scarier, deliberately coordinated effort to control the whole country so it‚Äôs impossible to escape their influence.

Things can definitely get worse and they probably will, but long term I think they‚Äôve already lost. Now we just gotta hope they don‚Äôt cause too much damage before the party dies off. My theory is that as the GOP is taken over by the crazies, the country as a whole will begin to look more like California. Moderate conservatives will become neoliberal/corporate democrats.

I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre in a difficult place in that they need the rhetoric to increase in intensity to keep their base but it‚Äôs only pushing more and more voters away.

2) You've gotta gameplan for how you're gonna convince the 30% of the party that's ride-or-die for Trump to vote for you in the general if Trump launches a third-party bid, otherwise you're done before you even really hit the general.

3) You're gonna have to figure out how to do (1) and (2) without pissing off a critical mass of independents you're gonna need to win over in order to beat Biden or whoever else is on the Democratic side.

And that's just the basics. So if you're Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, Mike Pompeo, Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Mike Pence, or whatever other microwaved fish the GOP is rolling out this week for President, you're gonna have to ask yourself how you solve for X up there, otherwise you're wasting a bunch of donor money.

2740,"Peel off something like 44,000 across 3 states (PA, WI, AZ I think) and Trump would be President.  While Biden won overwhelmingly in the popular vote, it's the electoral vote and thus individual district votes in swing states that elects the President.

Trump peeling off even 1% of the national vote would probably end up with enough votes in purple states (particularly the 3 above) to ensure a Democratic win.  One of the best things Dems can do in 2024 is to quietly ""push"" Trump against the GOP candidate (assuming Trump doesn't outright win their primary).",-1,-1
2741,No shit,-1,-1
2742,"Of course he won't! Don't the Republicans get it yet? He's not a fucking Republican. He never was. Theirs was just the easiest party to take over.

2746,He won't even commit to respecting the results of an election he loses. Why would he affirmatively support someone who beat him?,-1,-1
2747,Good let them eat themselves,-1,-1
2748,This is nothing new he did the same thing in 2015 when he was running for the nomination . What will be interesting is if he has the balls to run as a 3rd party . It‚Äôs highly unlikely he will get the GOP nomination .,-1,-1
2749,It's not like he committed to this back in 2016 either.,-1,-1

Be still my heart.

2816,"You will get your wish. There is absolutely zero chance that Trump will endorse another GOP candidate for president in 2024. In fact, if he is not the GOP candidate for president in 2024 he will run as an independent or his own MAGA cult party and split the vote handing the GOP a guaranteed loss. He doesn't give a single fuck about anyone but himself. I'd bet everything I own on it. The GOP is absolutely fucked.

edit: typo",-1,-1
2817,"Trump doesn't give a fuck about the GOP, and would be more than willing to split the ticket if he isn't nominated to 'punish' the party.  Unless he's barred from office, I absolutely can see this happen.",-1,-1
2818,"Idk, hedging bets I think. Moag likely, he plows forward proving he controls a large % of the GOP base until the federal indictments show up. He then behind the scenes exchanges his withdrawal and desantis endorsement for a blanket pardon, essentially guaranteeing the drsantis win. Then all that's left is to concoct the years long delay tactics to wait out the clock on the state charges.",-1,-1
2819,Right? I want him to split the ticket with whatever awful person the GOP nominates. Biden/whoever would coast to victory at that point.,-1,-1
2820,"*He is the chosen one,* destined to destroy the party no matter what. If he wins the primary then he will lose the general and take many down with him. If he loses the primary then he will also lose the general in his independent run and split the MAGA/Conservative vote to ensure a Democratic victory. For this reason, while I had been hoping for his quick indictment and conviction, I now hope they wait until after the next election before incarcerating him. *And so the prophesy shall be fulfilled!*",-1,-1
2821,I would be amazed if it isn't true.  Twice imPeached cares for nothing but himself.,-1,-1

2835,He won't lose. (High probability of winning) He has enough support left to get just 30 percent of the vote and the field of nominations is most likely going to be more then just a few people. They will eat away at the total and therefore Trump will win with just enough to take it.,-1,-1

If they make DeSantis the candidate, they have to sell the idea that a vote for Trump is basically a vote for the Democrat and hope they don't lose too many from the far right.",-1,-1

Harris gets all 20 of Pennsylvania's Electors. A unified party will almost always beat a divided party in this contest. Even deep red Utah could be in play with a serious split. Utah votes about 1/3rd Democratic and 2/3rds Republican. If the split in Utah is 50-50 on the Republican side between a Trump/Desantis line up, it is possible for Harris to win deep red Utah.",-1,-1

Realistically though, in the event of a Biden/DeSantis/Trump three-way election, it would be very difficult for Biden not to clear 270. Biden would have a puncher's chance at winning a whole bunch of red states with a plurality, like Texas. Biden 45, DeSantis 40, Trump 15, something like that.",-1,-1
2891,That's not a problem though because a unified party would absolutely clean up against a split vote party. Harris would cruise with likely 350+ ECV.,-1,-1

3021,"In his interview with Axios around the end of July 2020, Trump defended the Russian government against accusations that it had placed a bounty on U.S. troops in Afghanistan and that it was arming Taliban militants against U.S. troops. There are at least two different ways to defend someone against an accusation. You can try to deny it, or you can try to excuse it. With a denial, you claim that they didn't do it. With an excuse you argue that it would be okay for them to do it.

If you think about it, the first way of defending the Russian government against this accusation could possibly be okay. After all, no matter what the accusation is or who the accused is, the truth matters. A denial was one of the defenses offered by President Trump for this accusation against the Russian government. He called it ""fake news"". If you think he reached this conclusion after sufficiently looking into it and without bias (which some would dispute), then you wouldn't find anything wrong with it.

He didn't stop there, however. When pressed about the issue of the Russian government arming the Taliban he said [the following](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HzB2tAUd64&feature=youtu.be&t=159). ""Well we supplied weapons when they were fighting Russia too."" If you don't think that's an excuse, you're deceiving yourself. It's an excuse. He excused the Russian government against accusations that it is arming the Taliban against U.S. troops.

It's also a bad excuse. Vladimir Putin has said similar things about accusations like this. The problem with it, even when put forward by Putin, is that it was such a long time ago and in a completely different era. Both countries need to let go of these Cold War era grievances to have any chance at peaceful relations. The Soviet Union supported North Korea and North Vietnam against us. Their spies stole the atomic bomb. They tried to arm Fidel Castro with nuclear weapons. Bringing up what we did in Afghanistan 40 years ago is just a low effort nonsensical excuse.

That's the problem with Putin making an excuse like this. With Donald Trump it's so much worse, because that wasn't not his job as President. Even if it were a good excuse, he was the President of *The United States of America*. He shouldn't have been making a list of reasons that it was supposedly okay for other countries to kill our soldiers. His job was to put America first. He didn't do that job.",-1,-1

     Reporter from AP: 

""Thank you. A question for each president. President Trump, you first. Just now President Putin denied having anything to do with the election interference in 2016. Every US intelligence agency has concluded that Russia did.

My first question for you, sir, is who do you believe? My second question is would you now with the whole world watching tell President Putin ‚Äî would you denounce what happened in 2016 and would you warn him to never do it again?""

     TRUMP: 

""So let me just say that we have two thoughts. You have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server. Why haven‚Äôt they taken the server? Why was the FBI told to leave the office of the democratic national committee? I‚Äôve been wondering that. I‚Äôve been asking that for months and months and I‚Äôve been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media. Where is the server? I want to know, where is the server and what is the server saying? With that being said, all I can do is ask the question. My people came to me, Dan Coats came to me and some others and said they think it‚Äôs Russia.

I have President Putin. He just said it‚Äôs not Russia. I will say this. I don‚Äôt see any reason why it would be, but I really do want to see the server [Trump later said he used the wrong word, claiming he meant to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any reason why it wouldn‚Äôt be Russia‚Äù]. But I have confidence in both parties. I really believe that this will probably go on for a while, but I don‚Äôt think it can go on without finding out what happened to the server. What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC? Where are those servers? They‚Äôre missing. Where are they? What happened to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails? 33,000 emails gone ‚Äî just gone. I think in Russia they wouldn‚Äôt be gone so easily. I think it‚Äôs a disgrace that we can‚Äôt get Hillary Clinton‚Äôs 33,000 emails. So I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that president Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. And what he did is an incredible offer. He offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators, with respect to the 12 people. I think that‚Äôs an incredible offer. Okay thank you.""",-1,-1

Also, I quoted something he said on the record in a major interview with full context of the question that was asked and the recent background circumstances that led to the quote.

You got me there. The Mueller report contains zero evidence that Trump excused an alleged Russian bounty program against our troops.

His first big failure was the revolution in 2014, when Yanukovych (Putin‚Äôs puppet) was forced out of office.  He‚Äôs been trying to use other corrupt figures since then with steadily decreasing results, which likely led to a failed coup attempt in November 2021, just months before the invasion (the coup was busted before it could happen).

I've said literally the opposite of this - that it can be fine to deny those allegations - multiple times.

There's also significant distinctions to be made, not least of which was that the US and Russia were trying to have normal relations at the time. If the Russian government wanted to act like the Soviet Union, then, at least short of our overly aggressive militaristic decisions like Vietnam, they should expect that we're going to treat them like the Soviet Union. No more ""reset"" if they were doing that. They weren't doing that, and it would have been potentially okay for Trump to conclude that they weren't doing it, even if he had been wrong.

What wasn't okay was him using generations old grievances to excuse (not just deny but excuse) an accusation of ongoing attacks on American troops. In order to give peace a chance, we have to look past all the antagonistic things the Soviet Union did against us in the Cold War. But Russia also has to look past all of the antagonistic things that we did against the Soviet Union.

When does an anti-Soviet policy by the US stop being an excuse for Russia to possibly pay for American troops to be killed? I'd say at least by the time they changed their whole system of government and stopped being the Soviet Union. When does it become unacceptable for a sitting present to excuse (again not just deny, but excuse) an accusation of an ongoing bounty program on American troops? I'd say immediately, because it wasn't his job to make that argument.",-1,-1

Add traffic and parking tickets to the growing list of legal and political woes facing embattled Rep. George Santos, a Republican from New York, who may owe more than $3,400 in unpaid citations, according to records from New York City and Florida.

A car registered to Santos was cited six times in 2016 and 2017 in Florida. Two tickets for running red lights were paid, but four toll violations racked up late fees and were ultimately sent to collections agencies according to Florida records. Santos, who represents New York's 3rd Congressional District, now owes $1,299.10 for those tolls.

Traffic violations may not be high on the list of worries for the freshman congressman, who is reported to be the subject of both federal and local investigations stemming from questions about the financing of his campaigns. But records show the fines could continue to pile up.

The way they're promoted is heavy-handed:  ""seat belts or death/jail"", similar to driving drunk.  It's a different way of thinking about laws that's just... part of society.  

I don't disagree with what I perceive to be the reasons for compulsory voting.  I'm just not convinced it's the only/best solution, particularly for the US as it exists.

Also in your edit, about only having to go get the paper ballot:  They could just mail everyone a ballot to fill out if they want to and return by mail, and that's the end of it.  That kind of thing would probably be even better in the US, because polling stations are not convenient places.",-1,-1

""My uncle, Dr. John Trump at MIT, was a great professor, scientist, and engineer. He had good genes, was very smart and graduated from the Wharton School of Finance. As a conservative Republican, I am often seen as disadvantaged, but if I were a liberal Democrat, I would be considered one of the smartest people in the world. The nuclear deal is a major concern as it has the potential to be very powerful. My uncle had explained this to me 35 years ago and he was right. The situation with the four prisoners, who were once three, shows that the Iranians are great negotiators and have defeated us. Women are smarter than men, but it will take another 150 years for that to be acknowledged.""

""My fellow Americans, let me start by talking about my uncle, Dr. John Trump, a brilliant professor, scientist, and engineer at MIT. He instilled in me an appreciation for the power of nuclear energy, which has been on my mind as we face the situation with the prisoners. The fact is, I have a strong educational background, having attended the Wharton School of Finance and built a successful career, but political affiliations can shape perception. Regardless, what troubles me most is the state of the current nuclear deal. Negotiations are not easy, especially with a talented adversary like the Iranians, but we must find a solution that prioritizes human lives above all else. Thank you.""",-1,-1

>In October 2022 Myers was charged with wiretapping in Ohio after his website, the Scioto Valley Guardian, allegedly published leaked audio from a murder trial.

absolute bullshit and I wish we could fix this on a federal level. Any trial that is open to the public should be able to be recorded and a judge shouldn't be able to stop it.

The only thing I would agree on is that a judge should be able to say 'no publishing of information till the end of the trial', just so the trial isn't affected by the publishing of information about the trial. I don't think publishing should come with jail time though, since it could also be non professionals publishing stuff, making controlling that situation difficult. 

Anyways, I actually think all states should be 1 party. My belief is that all party recording laws are designed to protect politicians when they lie behind closed doors. These laws are not designed to protect the average citizen, in fact the exact opposite.

He must be aware that, if Trump somehow won in 2024, the country would once again go blue after 4 more years of Trump. The last time he won is poisoned the next 3 elections for republicans. So, DeSantis would have a much worse chance of winning if he waited until 2028. Especially after Trump inevitably attempts to change the rules to allow him to run for a 3rd term.

The Conservative subreddit was pretty much ready to ditch Trump after the midterms. They've cooled a bit on that now, and are not paying much attention to these little jabs.

As to DeSantis, his milquetoast, former-Republican opponent has run and lost in 2 of the last 3 gubernatorial elections. Nobody wanted Crist other than his subset of Democratic primary voters. There was 0 excitement around that campaign and very little money. Added to that is the fact that DeSantis's COVID policy made Florida a hot spot for MAGA migration in the 2 years immediately preceeding the election. None of those factors is going to apply in a national election.

He could win an electoral college victory while losing the popular vote like W and Trump before him, but expecting a landslide is an exercise in self-delusion.

Firstly, he's a less masculine Shrek.  

Secondly, he's already fucked the suit part up. Even in his own damned staged event to make him look like a big tough man of the people, he embarrasses the shit out of himself. (see: the white boots)   

Finally, he's too much of a chickenshit to actually say the shit outright, even more so than Trump. Sure, he can point to racist policies he's instituted in Florida, but he doesn't have it in him to go out and say publicly there's good people on both sides when one side is literal fucking nazis.",-1,-1
5107,"I‚Äôve been seeing DeSantis signs up here in Indiana for months. He‚Äôll do fine on the national stage. He might not be as popular as Trump, but he appeals to the base.

I think DeSantis can start off strong, but I don't think he has the charisma to actually keep them interested in him. Trump is charismatic in a weird way that I've been struggling to describe. He's vile, and stupid, and nuts, and yet listening to him is entertaining as hell. I watch a lot of full Trump speeches and interviews because I always laugh my ass off. DeSantis just doesn't have that. I've tried to watch stuff of him too, but he can't keep my attention at all. 

People like DeSantis right now because they're seeing headlines where he does stuff they like. I think he'll start to lose steam when people are actually hearing him speak more. I can see him winning the primary still, but if Trump runs 3rd party, or tells his base to stay home and not vote, it could be enough to kill DeSantis.",-1,-1

5115,Don't see why they wouldn't. He's been one of the best presidents America has seen in generations.

 Bernie is too old (if we keep the same energy we have for Biden).

 Beto has that losing track record and not much experience besides.

1) Handled the whole railroad potential strike, by taking away their right to strike, over sick leave. This will not help rebuild the middle class. 

2) Housing needs to be addressed.  What they had done and proposed to address is so tiny. 

3) I don't like how he has handled student debt. Education needs to be more affordable. Forgiving X amount of student debt isn't fixing the problem. 

4) When he spoke about Beau dyeing in Iraq. Beau didn't die in Iraq. It left me stunned. I feel for any parent who has lost a child. It left me wondering about his mental state.",-1,-1

But look at his electoral history. In 2022, he beat the record for most votes casted for a candidate. The record he beat? Himself in 2016 when he ran for AG. He got more votes than either Clinton or Trump‚Äî he got a majority unlike trump‚Äôs plurality win. Meaning he had a good crossover appeal. 

He did something right like Jason Kander did in 2016 (even if Kander didn‚Äôt win).

In fact, Trump literally put a tax plan in place that taxes the middle and lower class more, while giving his rich buddies more breaks. Now the morons in the house want to tax everyone 30%. That's bullshit. The ""you earn more, you pay more"" is infinitely more fair.

Now, on top of all that, Nikki Haley of all people is about to announce that she‚Äôs going to challenge Trump for the GOP nomination for 2024. Considering how much time this woman spent kissing that wrinkled old fool‚Äôs pasty white ass, the fact she‚Äôs considering taking him on means she doesn‚Äôt have any more loyalty for him and thinks she has a chance to beat him.

The Republicans are ripping each other to shreds and you can see it happening every single day. They‚Äôre a fractured mess who can‚Äôt even agree what direction they want to take the country in while the Democrats are, for the most part, standing in unison and trying to actually govern.

If there is some mass armed uprising, in theory, it‚Äôll be relatively easy to put down. 

The issue is more a legal coup that‚Äôs supported by law enforcement, the military and secret service.

It‚Äôs pretty clear from January 6 that these organizations are compromised, at least in part. The worry should be that elements of the GOP attempt to force a Constitutional crisis, this is supported by the Supreme Court, the military and law enforcement, OR if there is an armed uprising of some kind, that elements of the military and law enforcement join in support rather than take action to uphold the law.",-1,-1

5276,"It may be helpful, though, insofar as it means all high schoolers will have a couple voting years, meaning our schools can play a role in embedding the voting habit early.

The confusing part, to me, is that Russia should have the information PRC would like. Why not just share the info. Is this just a publicity stunt, or is it a tactic to terrorize the public? Is this a warning to the US for supporting Ukraine?

Maybe this balloon is able to gather more information than what PRC‚Äôs satellites, or Russia, could gather? Maybe Russia won‚Äôt divulge this information to PRC? I know about the ‚Äògames‚Äô Russia and the US play with entering one another‚Äôs airspace, but this one has me stumped.

The definition of legal insanity is very specific and limited, so you absolutely can prove that someone is not legally insane in many cases (not always, but often). For example proving that someone took steps to cover up their crimes would be enough to disprove an insanity defense in most cases since it shows they knew what they did was wrong.

Ken Paxton, our Attorney General has been under active indictment since 2015 on state securities fraud yet he continues to stay in office.  He actively skirts the legal system he took an oath to uphold by running and hiding from process servers tasked with issuing him subpoenas.

Many of our voting districts are included in the list of most gerrymandered districts in the nation.  This has led to a situation where despite the fact that well over half our population votes democrat, only republicans get elected.

Greg Abbott, our governor, uses this artificial replublican majority to pass state level laws that effectively invalidate city/county level laws passed by more progressive cities.  These laws mandate forced birth on rape victims, prohibit environmental reforms ( plastic bag bans among others ) , restrict cities ability to reform their own police departments, as well as cities ability to reduce gun violence, even in the wake of an unprecedented number of mass killings.

6243,"The problem with public education in Texas is that it's not great, mostly because of funding. It's not funded because it's controlled by Republicans who don't want to fund it. (they want  vouchers for credit for private, or religion in school).  So then this cycle starts where people with 'good' kids and money get fed up, pull their kids out of public and go private (or homeschool).  Then the general population of the public school is worse because the smart kid is pulled out.  Then the school is worse off. The teachers are more annoyed dealing with higher percentage problem kids and eventually the teacher(s) leave.  Eventually, the public school becomes a realistic joke, and no one sends their kids there unless they have no other choice because the school is now a 3rd world country.  It's really sad. 

If you have any doubt, look at Houston ISD as an example.  A handful of elementary schools are great.  Even less middle schools.  And very few high schools, honestly maybe 2. 

And the schools that are good, are only good because they rely heavily on PTA donations from parents to provide the things the school actually needs.  Basically the good schools are essentially semi private.  If you think I'm exaggerating, the public school we used to go to with 800 students regularly raised 300-400k in a year.  The bad school next zone over, 8k in a year.  No wonder that school is terrible.

Houston is an enormous city.  This should not be the case.

*****
> More than two years since a mob attacked the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, a new survey released Friday found that fewer Texans are certain democracy is the best form of government.

> The percentage of Texas adults who rated the quality of K-12 as excellent or good dropped to 55%. The percentage of those who rated it as poor or terrible increased to 39%. &quot;The reality is it&#039;s impossible to say exactly what led to that, but it&#039;s pretty easy to surmise that the long tail of COVID-related closures and changes to education have had an impact, but also the explicit politicization of K-12 public education with culture war issues,&quot; Blank said.

> &quot;Two fundamental institutions of American culture have been democracy and public education,&quot; Blank said.

If you want to laugh-scream go ahead and look up the Austin districts. Anyone looking at those will lose all faith that democracy still exists in Texas.",-1,-1
6261,Well they did fuck all about it this last election.,-1,-1
6262,Failed state.,-1,-1
6263,I think the problem with Texas is it doesn't have ideological variety among its elites. They are all conservative. It's different from the coasts where rich or important people are intellectually diverse and there's a mixture of libertarian and liberal ideas and open-mindedness. Not sure why this is.,-1,-1
6264,It‚Äôs working as intended.,-1,-1

6280,"Pretty sure both of those are desirable outcomes from the conservative side. ""Likely voters"" in the state lean heavily republican, which means a lack faith in the electoral system is more likely to discourage democratic voters.

6295,Texas is an extremely corrupt state. Anything that receives public funding has a certain degree of corruption including educational institutions and the very auditors they hire for internal reviews. It's a rotten state.,-1,-1

6299,The two are certainly connected! Unlike the Texas energy grid‚Ä¶,-1,-1

6301,"Today I started reading Tom Nichols's 2021 book *[Our Own Worst Enemy: The Assault From Within On Modern Democracy](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/our-own-worst-enemy-9780197518878)*. He writes in the introduction that a democracy is only as good as those who cast the votes (pp. 8-9):

> In a liberal democracy, citizens are the masters of their fate. If we believe democracy has failed us, we should first ask ourselves whether we have failed the test of democracy. . . . In a democracy, the people are responsible for their own happiness and for the safety of their own freedoms, but they are also often the source of their own problems.",-1,-1
6302,"Just heard an ad on the radio here in College Station today from a state congresswoman, giving **pro-school choice** points, claiming that we‚Äôre coming for the kids through CRT, Drag Queens, and teachers telling students it‚Äôs okay to hate America.

Only after these three bullshit claims, does she mention the statistic that X % of high school grads are not employed or enrolled in higher education after 6 months of graduation.

Like, shouldn‚Äôt that be what we‚Äôre focusing on? Nah. That‚Äôs fourth on the list.

If things don‚Äôt change, my wife and I will be moving out of state, or homeschooling (no kids yet).",-1,-1
6303,"Always interesting to read the ""Texan edition"" textbooks",-1,-1
6304,Nah they blame the teachers. They think state legislature have to pass authoritarian laws that will get their teachers in line. How they don‚Äôt realize this will just lead to teachers not working in their State because they get treated like crap is beyond me. This will just end with bigger class sizes and poorly educated students.,-1,-1

6308,You mean anti-semitic conspiracy theorist Greg Abbott,-1,-1
6309,It's an abusive relationship. GOP voters have been told multiple times that they'll never find anyone better.,-1,-1
6310,All time low approval but still nearly half the state approves. Bleak.,-1,-1
6311,"> But, according to the poll, 48% of Texans either somewhat or strongly disapprove of the job Abbott is doing as governor. That‚Äôs in contrast with 47% of Texans who answered the same in 2022.


I am confused by the comparison/contrast of 47% vs 48% here. Am I misinterpreting something?",-1,-1
6312,"It‚Äôs easier to complain about other peoples choices than to make a stand and not get your way. It‚Äôs the same reason people don‚Äôt study for tests they ‚Äúknow‚Äù they‚Äôre gonna fail, or not do any work on a group project so they can talk shit about the end result. 

Yes, there is voter suppression but not to the degree of people just opting out bc they don‚Äôt feel like making a compromise",-1,-1
6313,"I agree with you. I recognized democracy was dead in Texas in the mid-aughts, so I left Texas. I'm legit surprised more people don't do the same. Life is too short to live in a fascist state.",-1,-1
6314,"> Many of our voting districts are included in the list of most gerrymandered districts in the nation. This has led to a situation where despite the fact that well over half our population votes democrat, only republicans get elected.

Gerrymandered, yes, but I think your problems run deeper than that.  You have active [vote suppression](https://www.lgbtmap.org/democracy-maps/voter_turnout_percentage) going on, and it shows in your turnout percentage.",-1,-1
6315,"If democracy was as cool as crypto, nfts, or facebook we wouldn't be having the same conversation. Point is we need to stop being distracted by shiny things and keep our eye on what matters.",-1,-1

6321,Ignorance sets you free,-1,-1
6322,"Wasn‚Äôt it Texas GOP that openly stated they were against teaching critical thinking?

Ah yes 

‚ÄúKnowledge-Based Education ‚Äì We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs that are simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) (mastery learning) which focus on behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging the student‚Äôs fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority.‚Äù

6326,I almost feel like a lot of Republican intransigence is rooted in that fact they just don‚Äôt WANT to admit their policies and politicians suck ass.

Because the only other option is admitting THEY‚ÄôRE the ones with the problem.,-1,-1
6327,"It isn't that they aren't self aware. Their politicians know perfectly well what they're doing.

The only time the word Semite has been used to refer to ethnic groups in a (semi) academic way is in the context of the eugenics movement. In the 19th century, European racial pseudoscientists were trying to figure out how to place Ashkenazi Jews in their fake racial hierarchy, and labeled them as ""Semites"" to give a scientific-sounding label to their belief that Jews were an inferior race of corrupting foreigners. This is the basic etymology of the word ""antisemitism"". The term has nothing to do with speakers of Semitic languages. Because of its history, the ""Semitic"" in ""antisemitism"" refers specifically to hatred of Jews.

  
Most people you see arguing that ""antisemitism applies to all Semites"" a) don't have a good grasp of the history behind the term b) probably have some kind of incentive to delegitimize or muddy the waters on what antisemitism means... which is usually a bad look.",-1,-1

When we stop teaching the idea of America, its history (both the great and the ugly), and what it aspires to be, it starts to slowly die.

Government officials, military and police can easily get away with crimes.  Legal bribery is rampant.  Racism, sexism and other forms of bigotry are tolerated.

6677,"This article was great - so great that I picked up the book (The Bill of Obligations) immediately after reading it last week.  I'm about 3/4 of the way through the book, and I gotta say I'm pretty underwhelmed.

For all the talk in the article about grounding the ideas that make us American in some sort of common history, the book (so far) absolutely fails to talk about **why** these obligations are important to Americans specifically and **why** this specific set of obligations is American.  Yes, each of the obligations laid out in the book is critical for preserving our democracy, but they apply to any democracy with no mention of what makes them uniquely American values.  Other established democracies around the world have seen similar backslides recently because their citizens are also failing in these obligations.  In other words: the book fails to relate what it means to be an American.

Given the lofty aspirations of the title, I think it's fair to contrast the obligations in this book against the rights protected by the Bill of Rights.  The Bill of Rights is based *directly* on the experience of colonial Americans under the rule of the King.  Every single amendment can be related to a specific historical example of when the King broke a long-standing tradition or law that had historically protected the rights of English subjects.  It speaks directly to the issues that were crucial to Americans (and no other people in the world) at the time it was ratified.

The only thing the author (Richard Haass) does seem to think is uniquely American is our obsession with our rights - which he believes is to the detriment of our society.  The book is a long-form argument that rights alone do not make a democracy.  That's fair, but the entire premise of the American experiment is ""that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--**That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed**[.]""  Our obligations as Americans must start from this premise, and we must be dedicated to protecting the rights of others as strongly as we protect our own cherished rights.",-1,-1

INTRODUCTION

America is a city on a hill. This theme echoes again and again throughout our history. 

‚ÄúFor we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us.‚Äù - John Winthrop, 1630

Perry Miller, mid-20th century Harvard University scholar of history, marked the arrival of John Winthrop in 17th century Massachusetts as the birth of America. US presidents took note of Millers‚Äô studies, and almost every president since, from JFK to Biden, has used the vision of the city on a hill to describe America.

I would guess the presidents used the description because it was hard to put into words their vision of America. A standard bearer, the shining example on display for the world to see. 

I believe America is a city on a hill.

America isn‚Äôt just a nation of land and people. It‚Äôs an ideal of liberty being more final than death. 

What makes America this city on a hill?

A democratic republic that balances rural and urban area influence. Individualism and personal liberty, without imposing on someone else‚Äôs liberty. Freedom from, and of, religion. The peaceful transition of power. The pursuit of purpose. The compassion for other Americans demonstrated by FDR. The ability to elevate your social status from humble beginnings. Equality of opportunity. The welcoming of those from around the world who would share our vision and seek individualism and liberty. 

These characteristics of America are the ‚Äòcity on a hill‚Äô. No matter the course of world events, that American ideal will go on. We need to hold ourselves accountable to the ideal.

You have no need to call me naive. I know America sometimes doesn‚Äôt rise to meet our expectations. Nothing reminds me of our challenges more than hearing the 2007 song ‚ÄòHands Held High‚Äô by Linkin Park.

‚ÄúTen years old, there's something to see
Another kid my age drug under a Jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought 'the next one could be me'

Do you see the soldiers that are out today?
They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday‚Äù

We were embattled in long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Certainly we had missteps. 

We continue to have some missteps today. Gun violence, especially in our schools. Insurrection that threatens our democratic republic. The lack of dignity and grace in our interactions. The 2-party thought that disagreement with someone means their perspective is wrong. 

Despite our challenges, I believe the American ideal is a city on a hill. The shining example for the world. I have seen too much of America, and met too many Americans from coast to coast, to doubt we will see our founding vision again and rise together to meet the challenge. 

In future pieces we can explore what makes America exceptional. Thanks for considering my perspective.

Its a means by which in vs out group think is enabled, and justified too.

7259,"The ""few hundred people caught up in a mob mentality"" entered the capitol building with the intent of preventing the results of a legitimate election from being enacted into law because their guy lost. They were literally yards away from key congressional personnel who had to flee for their safety, they were chanting that they wanted to hang the vice president of the united states, and they absolutely *intended* to overturn the results of a free and fair election if they could.

The defense of ""they weren't near to being able to accomplish it"" doesn't hold water to me, because 1.) They were making a real attempt and 2.) I think they were closer to success than you do.

61% of republicans don't believe Biden won a free and fair election, despite precisely none evidence to support that position.

As of June of last year, more republicans felt that 1/6 was a ""legitimate protest"" than a ""riot.""

33% of Republicans support the actions of the insurrectionists.

Disregard a lot of this comment, I assumed this was a bunch of heavy metal and not easily mistaken for a toy. \]

Original comment:

This is a little too culture-warsy for me.

If the adult product were even _approaching_ being _remotely_ adequately regulated, what would it matter advertising or selling a smaller product for children under those regulations?

Do they not think kids in rural areas are going to be trained to use firearms for hunting/sport/whatever? Would the lack of appropriately sized guns be helpful for those kids to safely train, or would them wielding fully adult-sized rifles or potentially more unwieldy for them (and therefore more dangerous) adult-oriented handguns be  better?

I feel this is both jumping the gun (pardon the expression) in that regulations for safe and responsible use in _general_ should be in place before banning product segments by age group, and because this is _counter-productive_, as the kids are going to be using guns in these families one way or another, and having one sized for a kid to ergonomically hold is actually _much safer_ than them struggling to wield an adult-sized, adult-weight gun.

\[ Edit to add: The risk with kids I feel is much more about the lack of judgment of where to shoot + their inability to aim or have discipline/foresight about where they aim. A least a long rifle like this one is less likely to point in a random direction, due to its length and the ability to get a stable two-point grip on it, and a kid would (I hope) be less likely to carelessly or cavalierly aim something that looks like an AR, compared to the more action-movie/wild-west-staple handgun or whatever.

At least it's not freaking rainbow-colored and looks exactly like a real gun, this thing hopefully isn't fooling anyone into thinking it's a toy (though I admit that could be somewhat of a concern, ~~but it's heavy metal not plastic~~ EDIT: Shit, it's literally plastic, not metal. WTF.). \]

I am not even a gun owner, never touched one, and I can see why this bill would be backward.

The NRA is there solely to distract the public from the NSSF. The NSSF is the firearms industry lobbying and policy group. They give the NRA their marching orders. 

Until the late 1990s the NSSF specifically prohibited their members from marketing military style weapons and equipment to the public. For big name manufacturers they visited licensed dealers and would not allow their firearms to be sold in stores that displayed any products that targeted militia groups/lifestyle or young people. It was adhering to those self imposed restrictions that gave rise to the off brand junk AR-15s of today. 

Below is a link to the NSSF website. They are the people driving the gun culture. They are THE dark money people who own the Congresspeople and judges who give guns to kids, domestic violence perpetrators and the nutters who held state capitals hostage during the pandemic.

You do see how that sentence is problematic, right? All it does is tell people ""hey, if you want to kill people, point this at them and pull the trigger""

We have a gun culture issue. Period. Full stop. It has gotten so bad that we just write off a fucking schoolroom full of kids getting massacred because ""muh gun rights"". The only solution now is to completely get rid of them. Gun nuts have had decades to solve the problem and here we are, worse than ever.",-1,-1

7514,"You are exactly the type of person that puts fuel into the fire. The type that demonizes things that end up becoming a fetish for those who aren't right in the head. 

By the way you speak of these things I frankly find it hard to believe you have much experience with firearms in general, you appear to think that everyone involved with them just wants to kill people and that's the only reason to have them.

Yes, teaching people that firearms are dangerous is a good thing. You teach respect of such things. You tell a kid not to walk out into the middle of the road, correct? Why? Well, cars don't stop on a dime, cars don't instantly stop for a kid every single time and at the end of the day the child can be taught into knowing all of this and knowing that walking into the road is a potentially dangerous situation. This is why we have cross walks.

Now apply all the same for a kitchen knife, a boat, wildlife, firearms and any number of things you can think of. With nearly everything we do there is a inherent risk, my career is in construction and I've never been injured to any serious degree, but I had seen near fatal injuries that could have been prevented.

I never said anywhere that the solution is to teach people how to use them, more so how they function (negligent discharges are a serious risk of injury or death that does occur), what the results are is safety is not followed and that they are not toys.

But, you home in on just the shooting deaths by people that are crazy enough to intend to go out and kill others. Many of those people are depressed if not mentally ill in some form or another. Many of them kill themselves after such acts, and quite a lot of them have a history of questionable acts throughout their lives that are ignored. 

An inanimate object is not and will not be the cause of anything if it is not used in such a way that it presents any danger to anybody. Cars don't crash into people on their own and we take the risk of being in a car accident any time we drive one, which most people do daily. 

I never denied that firearms don't present some kind of a risk, in fact you cherry picked and edited lines to make it seem the opposite. I even stated that "" I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything dangerous about the object, it‚Äôs the person. The object empowers some of these people though."" which is me actually agreeing that firearms tend to allow people to commit these large scale killings. 

However, these types of people would do it by other means. Vehicles running over people, bombs, knifes, acids, blunt objects, chainsaws, swords and even things such as fire pokers have and will continue to be used. 

Yearly deaths by vehicle crashes, smoking, alcohol, suicide, cancer and obesity continue to individually outweigh the deaths by firearms of any kind.

Most of these issues would seem to be health or mental health issues. These could be solved to a degree by cheaper, more accessible and affordable health care. I know I sure wish I had that as a teenager, for both mental health and physical health, would have made a world of difference and helped with issues I still face today.

I'm quite unsure why you come off so strongly on me, I was only advocating   for education which may help inform people and save lives. Decades ago we did not have this issue, and certainly on a wide scale and yet firearms and ammunition were bought through the mail with no questions asked, no background checks were needed, children brought firearms to school to shoot after school as well as hunt and schools had shooting teams. Some still do, mind you.

So, with easier access to firearms in the past, how is it that in the last thirty or so years we have had this become such a serious problem? I don't have the answers, so please don't snark on me for that one. I have speculations which some of them seem to be common ones, but because I wasn't around back then and because they're just my ideas I tend to keep them to myself.

So once again, taking something away entirely isn't the answer. Look how well that worked for sex, meth, heroine and any number of things (18th amendment) and any other drug in general. If you live near Portland Oregon just go downtown and look around. I try not to anymore, because it's a sad state of affairs. 

I'm really not against you here, I have plenty of ideas that should be done in my opinion and not enough is being done. I actually think some of what is being done is more lip service than anything else, but then we turn the corner and see the US healthcare system and run into the same issues. 

Things need to change, that's for sure. The people who are REALLY into firearms are... Well, the last few gun shows I've gone to have been filled with interesting people..., but a full on ban of something just does not work. If you take something away people will do what they can to get it back or keep doing it, even if they didn't care before. 

I just enjoy functional history, and I'd be sad to let some crazy nutjobs take away my ability to share it with others. Looks like it's headed that way though, because I'm just lumped in with the rest of the lot.",-1,-1
7515,"To your last part, there was a video of a guy here the other day that shot a guy who was speeding down his road. The guy who would shoot him yelled at him as he drove by. The guy backed up and asked what the guy was yelling about while he got out of the truck to talk to him. After a very brief talk, the guy shot the unarmed speeder in the chest. As he tried to get back to his vehicle, the guy decides (which he later admitted) that he assumed the guy he shot was going back to his car to shoot back at him. So he did the only thing he could; he put 3 more rounds into his back. He then screamed at the dying man/corpse, went through his things, moved his own truck (which was partially in the road) into his driveway, called the police, and claimed he was almost shot and had to defend himself.

With the gun culture comes the scenario of ""how can I manipulate this situation to try get away with murder."" Fortunately a street camera caught everything but some audio.",-1,-1

Under no circumstances would they assert that liberals have no right to share their opinions. Anyone on the right who thinks differently is an idiot or a fascist or both. Here on Reddit, I‚Äôve noticed more and more that the left side of the aisle is far more inclined to immediately attack, misconstrue, denounce, insult, and smother anything that challenges their settled position or narrative.

What did Nixon call the Birchers again?    How did he respond to them in his 1962 gubernatorial campaign?

What did William F. Buckley write in the National Review about Jack Welch?  Were his statements supported in any way in any congressional statements from GOP leadership in 1965?

How did Eisenhower basically end McCarthy's overreach using the powers of the Executive branch?

There was a time the GOP kept their kooks in the fringes because the necessities of the cold war required it.  As a bunch of simpletons (or to quote Barry Goldwater about his own supporters:  ""commie-haunted apple pickers"" and ""cactus drunks"") the GOP was easier to keep in line when facing a clear external threat because that's how their pea brains are wired.  Tribalism has a hierarchy after all.

The Trump campaign did appeal to Russia to hack the DNC and release damning emails, which they did. And the Republican head of the FBI did release stuff about Hillary's emails (which turned out to be nothing) just before the 2016 election which almost surely did impact the results.

The IRS focus on lower income audits that happen automatically and by mail is precisely because the IRS is underfunded and understaffed, as it's too expensive and requires too much manpower to go after rich tax cheats and complex tax schemes.

>Audit rates plummeted across the board after the GOP took back Congress in 2010 and proceeded to eviscerate the IRS‚Äôs enforcement budget. From 2011 to 2017, audits of EITC claimants declined by about 45 percent, but **audits of taxpayers reporting income of $500,000 or more fell way more steeply**‚Äîby as much as 78 percent.

>Starved of funding and accounting manpower by Republican lawmakers, the IRS bean-counters **all but gave up on complex, high-dollar audits in favor of automated audits by mail‚Äîwhich now make us some 70 percent of all audits**, and which the authors emphasize are ‚Äúsubstantially cheaper‚Äù and ‚Äúcan be particularly burdensome for lower-income households.‚Äù

>Last year‚Äôs Inflation Reduction Act, which not a single congressional Republican supported, replenished the IRS‚Äôs coffers with almost $80 billion over 10 years. **The enforcement component (roughly $46 billion) is expected to yield a 450 percent return by restoring the IRS‚Äôs ability to collect the taxes owed by rich Americans**‚Äîincluding former president Donald Trump‚Äîwho were rarely audited on his watch. Congressional Republicans are trying to repeal the new funding via the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act‚Äîa curious moniker for a bill that would mainly protect tax *cheaters*.

>The House bill also aims to claw back $403 million from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, a watchdog that generates reports such as this one, noting that **the IRS had failed to collect more than 60 percent of 2019 taxes‚Äîsome $2.4 billion‚Äîstill owed by delinquent individuals with incomes of $1.5 million and up**. In 2020, the Inspector General reported that **nearly 880,000 ‚Äúhigh income‚Äù non-filers from 2014 through 2016 still owed the government $46 billion‚Äîand that the 300 biggest delinquents owed about $33 million per head, on average.**",-1,-1

>Black taxpayers, **who accounted for an estimated 21 percent of EITC filers, were selected for 43 percent of the audits**. Now, IRS staffers don‚Äôt sit around deciding whom to audit‚Äîthe selection is algorithmic and nominally race-blind. But the agency‚Äôs secret sauce somehow produced results that are far from colorblind.

>Lacking access to the code‚Äîwhich is indeed secret‚Äîthe authors tried out different models to make sense of the disparity, and suggested ways that the IRS might fix the problem. Race-wise, for instance, one gets very different results using an algorithm that emphasizes the likelihood of any under-reporting of income by EITC claimants vs one that emphasizes the magnitude of under-reporting.

The IRS as an organization is very much built around the rules. Following the rules, knowing the rules, enforcing the rules, etc. Exceptions do exist. But the rule is that the rules exist and must be followed. They also don‚Äôt like how the Congress has grossly over-complicated the tax code. Reading some of the IRS reports and studies is a fascinating exercise; they are frustrated as an organization and as people who pay taxes themselves. 

If we want change we have to go through the legislative process. Unfortunately.

For example, the IRS is certainly best positioned to process the overwhelming majority of tax filings. But it isn‚Äôt allowed to. Why? Because there are multi billion dollar enterprises built on filing taxes and portions of those revenues fund campaigns. Plus, distrusting the taxman is kind of central to the American story and ethos. 

When was the last time you looked at your withholdings and thought ‚Äúhell yeah! Doing my part! Woo!‚Äù Never. The answer is never. 

Or when was the last time we met an IRS agent and thought ‚Äúman, that person is doing it right. Making sure everyone is contributing to all the goods and services afforded to us just by living in this country.‚Äù Never.

>Despite race-blind audit selection, we find that **Black taxpayers are audited at 2.9 to 4.7 times the rate of non-Black taxpayers**. The main source of the disparity is **differing audit rates by race among taxpayers claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).**

...

>Black taxpayers, who accounted for an estimated 21 percent of EITC filers, were selected for 43 percent of the audits

What is *actually happening* is a racially disparate and unjust outcome as a result of ostensibly neutral policy and methods. It's not an ""appearance"" of systemic racism. It is an *example*.

8087,">I didn't think of it before but people who accept the hypothetical IRS-prepared return and tax bill would not be eligible for audit.

And **that's** why it's a horrible system which won't get implemented.

Situation:

IRS prepares taxpayer A's income tax return (ITR), based on their W-2 wage income.  Credits them for their withholding, and taxpayer A is found to be eligible for a refund of $500.  Taxpayer A knows there is undisclosed income (we'll get to this in a second) and readily accepts the return / refund.

IRS prepares taxpayer B's ITR.  Treats taxpayer B the same as taxpayer A, taxpayer B has wages, and gets withholding, and is offered a refund of $500.

Taxpayer B disputes this.  The IRS didn't give him credit for his mortgage interest!  He has a private mortgage to taxpayer A, and has paid $20,000 of mortgage interest to taxpayer A.  He demands the IRS give him proper credit, and the IRS, being bound to the law, does so.  Taxpayer B's refund after the mortgage interest deduction is increased by $750.

Now the IRS, armed with adequate records to make proper assessment, turns back to taxpayer A, who has $20,000 of undeclared interest income, and owes an additional $250 of income taxes.  And they can't do anything.

This is called an Assessment in the Alternative situation; there is a liability which may be assessed to more than one person.  One person's deductions are typically another person's income (excepting for personal deductions - standard deduction, exemption deduction).

**That's a problem.**  This system would cost the state a lot of revenues.",-1,-1
8088,"This might make me sound strange, but I don't mind paying my share of taxes‚Äînote that I say this as a socialist.  For reference, my household's federal income tax liability is about $20k a year, give or take.  My wife is a Soldier and I see how government spending has helped regular folks (especially younger Servicemembers) make a decent living and provides needed services.

Similarly, my state tax liability is about $6k.  Again, I never mind paying it and my state does a damn decent job of providing needed services at that level.

And my wife's late friend (died in the 2000s) was an IRS agent who was a decent and kind person who did her best to help the average taxpayer.  My mother-in-law had positive interactions with the IRS a few years ago when she needed to sort out some issues with her small business taxes.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that there are some exceptions.

Edit to add: I do agree that some simplification of the tax code is needed.  I don't work in that area (as my full-time role is in telecom), but surely there are improvements that can be made.",-1,-1

We shouldn't avoid detection methods that reduce false positives because it benefits whites, or increases true positives because it impacts non-whites.",-1,-1

Targeting a particular subset of the population based on valid metrics that just happens to coincide almost exactly with a single racial minority is not a good look, but it isn't automatically racism.  It could still be valid.  You may want to change it anyway because a less efficient outcome is more desirable than the appearance of impropriety, but that's not the same as it actually being systemic racism.",-1,-1
8095,"I'm not exactly understanding how the IRS would not be able to audit. While this isn't current law, any theoretical implementation would have the taxpayer swearing under penalty of perjury that the return the IRS prepared is correct to the best of their knowledge, and I would know of no clear reasoning that would define the IRS as being ineligible to press further in under- or unreported income scenarios.

We don't like the word subsidy in the US, so instead of granting subsidies on the front end, we grant tax credits and deductions on the back end.

An example would the tax credits you can receive for adding solar panels to your home. As the system currently stands, you need to pay for the solar panels in full up front, and then get your subsidy on the back end when you file your tax return. If instead the subsidy was applied on the front end and your solar panels where simply 30% cheaper to the consumer, and the US government pays the additional 30% to the manufacturer upfront, you wouldn't have to apply for the tax credit on the backend simplifying your return.",-1,-1

Separate them from society and then rehabilitate them so they can be reintroduced and be productive members.  This isn't always possible but that is why we have life sentences without parole.

This zero sum mindset is what prevents us from having a better society.  I'm sorry your DUI prevents you from getting the opportunities you want.  You deserve an opportunity for rehabilitation and redemption like these prison inmates.  That doesn't mean that we shouldn't have this service because you would benefit from it too if our criminal justice system was rehabilitation oriented rather than punishment oriented.  You were punished but given no opportunity to correct your mistake.

And most states (44/50) request/require the asking of female high school athletes for information about their periods.

The American Academy of Pediatrics encourages this because:

>‚ÄúFemale athletes/athletes with uteri who are not having menstrual periods are at increased risk of stress fractures,‚Äù Carl said.

And other states do weird shit too:

>Among other states, **Massachusetts** does currently suggest an **examination of ‚Äúgenitalia.‚Äù** Other states also suggest genital examinations, some of them like Oklahoma and Michigan singling that out for ‚Äúmales only,‚Äù or like New York asking if male athletes ‚Äúhave only one testicle.‚Äù

&nbsp;

What is weird about Florida is that some states only require the doc signs a form sent to the government that says the athlete is cleared for sports.

8591,"QE creates more money in the economy.  The mechanisms are inconsequential, the final effect is that there is more money.  Your description of bond purchases is only a partial view - what happens is much more complicated, in that it makes bonds less attractive for investment with low rates, and more importantly stimulates more borrowing and debt through increased available liquidity.  Influenced by low interest rates, this cascades through the financial system to create more money in circulation throughout the economy.

The historically low interest rates and new reserve model for banking introduced circa 2008 means that money reserves are no longer required.  The money multiplier doesn't even really hold things back like it once did, as [the fed will always cover bank reserves](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/page1-econ/2021/09/17/teaching-the-linkage-between-banks-and-the-fed-r-i-p-money-multiplier).

8598,I do hope that Trump is the nominee. And does the perp walk right before the election.,-1,-1
8599,Having Trump croak doesn‚Äôt get rid of his freakish spawn that have political ambitions of their own.,-1,-1
8600,"As I keep saying, I am way more worried about Ron Desantis. He is breaking every rule of democracy there is and yet there seems to be little push back. 

We have beaten Trump and will again.",-1,-1

Republicans are so brave!  Like those who whined about how wrong the vote was to remove Ilhan Omar but ..... still voted to.    


If you join the military, ask if your partner in the foxhole is a Republican.  They don't have your back.",-1,-1
8602,The GOP hopes that someone keeps feeding him cheeseburgers.,-1,-1

8604,">... multiple Republican officials who see no way to stop Trump from destroying the party in yet another electoral cycle.

Here comes that leopard we're always talking about.",-1,-1
8605,Talk about political impotence.,-1,-1
8606,I'm imagining these snakes doing something to speed the process and trying to pin it on Democrats. I really don't think there's a line they wouldn't cross if it meant staying in power.,-1,-1
8607,‚ÄúWaiting‚Äù is not a plan,-1,-1
8608,Waiting until he loses interest isn't a plan of action. It's literally doing nothing. The least they could do is pray that he goes away.,-1,-1

The GOP seriously could not be more incompetent or stupid. I could drink myself silly, half ass everything, and do a far better job than them. The fact that I have morals and the genuine desire to help others means that I won't ever do that but still. Also the fact that I'm not a hateful ghoul bent on discriminating against other people means that I would never support them or want them to do well but Jesus, that is such a stupid plan and is basically a cop out because of their severe intellectual limitations.

So I guess I'm saying, carry on basically. I won't point out any viable solutions because I genuinely can't stand what that party stands for.  It targets my good friends and I find them morally repulsive. I welcome them eating each other alive the next election.",-1,-1

8629,Also Garland's plan to avoid actually doing his job.,-1,-1
8630,Do you think any of the GOP is shady enough to actually try and have him killed?,-1,-1

None of Donald Trump‚Äôs opponents ever have the balls to throw him the damn brick. They just hope someone else will. Hope isn‚Äôt a winning strategy.",-1,-1

You mean from 60 years ago?",-1,-1
8638,">there‚Äôs a line they wouldn‚Äôt cross if it meant staying in power.  

That describes leaders and politicians since the beginning of time.  Power is intoxicating and very difficult to let go of.  It really is a marvel we have peaceful transfers of power.  Human nature suggests everything against that.",-1,-1
8639,By lobotomizing Desantis?,-1,-1
8640,They did a blood test and found out they are all rich.,-1,-1
8641,"As soon as he became president, he gained access to 24/7 *heroic* measures to keep him alive. I imagine that those mostly remain in place for former presidents, given how few of them there are, and how the general right-leaning imperial mindset operates. Having former presidents die too soon out of office would inflame both conspiratorial thinking and a primal intuition that the empire is weak.",-1,-1
8642,"Remember when he had the world champion college B-ball team over to the White House to honor them and served Whoppers.  Not the candy or the phrase to refer to lies, the burger.  DJ ""classy"" Trump strikes again.",-1,-1

8648,He'll be a lot easier to beat than DeSantis. He has a losing record.,-1,-1
8649,Garland will go where he's pressured to go. He doesn't have much will of his own. The evidence put together by Scowling Smith will force him into it.,-1,-1
8650,can confirm,-1,-1
8651,"I don't at all think that this describes *every* leader since the beginning of time. There are plenty of honorable and benevolent leaders. We've seen snakes like Trump before though, and should have known better than to let him anywhere near power.",-1,-1
8652,I still think every single fast food employee up-selling him at a fast food restaurant is doing an important job in helping protect the future of democracy.,-1,-1
8653,Big ups on that one,-1,-1
8654,By the same people!,-1,-1

I am reminded about after the 2012 election where Romney lost and the GOP put together an autopsy. In their autopsy they learned that their base is shrinking and will need to appeal to other demographic groups if they wish to win elections. They chose to double down on the small tent.

I went on DDG and scrolled through two pages of articles and the popular consensus is that it's for scientific weather analysis - the ONLY articles I seen that were fear mongering about it was Fox and their affiliates with wild theories about sabotaging airplanes and being 'close to its final target'.

It's unfortunate that the balloon is Chinese because that is simply an easy way to twist this into political gain by spreading fear and irrational 'what if's?!?'.

I seen an article where China was actually asking America to not turn this into more than it actually is - which they claim is strictly science. I seen the theories coming from a mile away as soon as I heard it was Chinese. If it were from 90% other countries, this would just be a quick news blip if that.

And I'm not sure what China would do if an American weather balloon floated over their airspace.

Pretty much. Under Abbott and Paxton, Texas has had a surge in sexual assault cases and its clearance rate has dropped by 18%.

When he passed an abortion bill, someone asked Abbott if Texas would force a female rape victim to give birth to her violators child.

Abbott basically said that question was moot because Texas would make ending rape ""priority one."" So no rape victim would have to give birth to her rapists child because there would be no rape kn Texas.

The opposite happened. Cases went up. Clearance rates ticked up like 2% into the 20's, lagging the national average by double digits

Paxton and Abbott are failing to deal with Texas' sexual crime problem, so they just blame it on gays and trans people instead.

Vermont utility companies had about 95% of the power back on in the state within 48 hours because the problem was power transmission not power generation.  Utility providers had linemen from Canada, Maine and New Hampshire here as a precaution because of the extreme weather and it paid off.

4. Beto wants to send in IRS agents to take my *antique non-functional* guns (yes, one person actually believed this because he listens to his crazy MAGA dad).

It was beyond infuriating. Even for my friends that that thought Beto was just as bad or horribly misinformed, I told them to at least vote for local elections and vote out Paxton, but they were convinced that because Beto was bad it meant everyone was bad.

-edit

Forgot to mention the friend was worried Beto wanted to take his antique completely non-functional guns. They have all had their barrels sealed or coated with something that makes them unable to function. They are **purely** decorative/collectible at this point.

One in every science class from elementary to university, to ensure science takes a second seat to creationism and American Exceptionalism.

One in every high school class to ensure critical thinking skills are suppressed.

One in every church, to ensure donations to political pacs are stimulated, and that the pastor/minister makes sure to tell the congregation to vote GOP, because Democrats are literal demons.

And when she was at the last line of defense, the last door before the mob was unleashed upon our congressional representatives, only then did they act in self-defense and eliminate the threat.

A big issue is that the Republicans try to break everything and add in a lot of fake oversight requirements that just make things harder. The Democratic party is also not exactly going to stick their necks out for you either.

An equal tragedy is our main stream media who are already dangerously normalizing him just like they did with Trump and are treating the coming fascism as entertainment.

Yeah. Totally.",-1,-1
10962,"You're not going to change the American car culture with tax credits for bikes, Jesus Christ. You might personally not like them (I also don't even own a car), but people need their cars to commute to work and pick up kids from school, then go to the grocery store. Good luck doing that on a friggin' bike.

I hate this argument so much. We've had a century of polluting fossil fuel vehicles and now that we're finally kicking that habit, you get people like you siding with the fossil fuel shills in opposing EVs.",-1,-1

Every morning I drive past families waiting on the school bus (in their cars too at the corner) to take the kids 3/4 of a mile to the elementary school or 5 miles to the high school.

Walking and biking paths that went from the living area to the destinations would take the car traffic away from the school area.

Walking and biking near-utopias exist, look at the Las Vegas strip, Disneyland. Everyone wants to go there and leave the cats behind because driving is a hassle.

Making driving to school a hassle and other modes of transport will arise.",-1,-1
10964,">so the school run or getting groceries or anything even remotely close 

Yes. It isn't the answer to everything, electric bicycles aren't single answer. My job is a +30 commute by car (and mostly highway and early), I recognize that an electric bicycle won't solve this, I will require more for my daily commute. However, there are **a lot** of short trips and regular errand runs that I perform that don't require a car, but are far enough to make an electric bike an undeniably better option. 

A majority of the US population cannot afford a new EV SUV, or any EV, even with the tax credits. In contrast, the vast majority of the US population would use electric bikes daily if there was no barrier to ownership. 

I'm willing to use myself as an example, I'm not better than anyone else. My commute by bicycle to work is not feasible, and remote work is not an option, so I still very much need a car at this time. However, I also use my SUV to run almost all my errands. Yes, I am lazy, I admit I am the problem. All that considered, if i received a tax credit that essentially resulted in a free (to me) electric bike, I would use it daily for all my errands. It isn't a total solution, but it would be far more effective",-1,-1
10965,">A majority of the US population cannot afford a new EV SUV, or any EV, even with the tax credits.

Obviously not, it's still a nascent market. But policy works with future goals in mind and this will change over the coming decade. Can't achieve affordability for a brand new product overnight, that's not how any of this works.",-1,-1

11003,"Backstory: Texas is full of ""Leadership Academies"" backed by Lizzie DeVos, yes the sister of Eric Prince of Blackwater fame, Drumpf's former Sec. of Education. They take public money to offer education in competition with public schools. Unfortunately, their students do worse on standardized tests than public school students.

It's just part of the ongoing Rethuglican effort to make a profit by destroying public education.",-1,-1
11004,"Right now in PA, the fucking charter school vultures are giving away computers to anyone who signs up for remote learning with them. They're advertising on popular podcasts and during the NFC/AFC championships on TV. It's literally just fucking embezzlement.",-1,-1
11005,Texas and education shouldn't be allowed in the same sentence.,-1,-1
11006,...And the GOP puts another nail in the coffin of public education.,-1,-1

11011,Jesus is gonna be locked and loaded in a few generations. Fuck the GOP.,-1,-1
11012,Good. I should have say where my tax dollars go. My school taxes go directly to the ISDs and are not being used to their fullest. Time to allow me to control where it goes.,-1,-1
11013,"Do you also have a say in what vehicles the military buys? No.

The taxes are used to fulfill the constitutional requirement to educate children. Giving away money to random third parties doesn't help solve that problem because those schools by necessity will cost more and have a profit motive rather than being directly dedicated to education. Besides that, since they're not required to take all children, they will necessarily require there to be two school systems funded by taxes, the private one and the public one which takes all the kids the private schools don't want to take.  Does paying twice for the same education make sense financially to you? Nope.",-1,-1
11014,"that‚Äôs why I won‚Äôt pay twice. i‚Äôm forced to allow the mediocre school to educate my kid.  or i pay (twice)for private or even a quality homeschool program. give me my voucher for schooling and let me be. besides‚Ä¶ the indoc going on in these schools is criminal. 

No more the day where I or anyone for that manner should trust the govt to educate our children. there was a time where teachers were unbiased and in the middle. never pushing agenda.",-1,-1

Like anyone with half a brain can see that the antisemitic party doesn‚Äôt care about condemning antisemitism but we‚Äôre supposed to believe that‚Äôs the case because they say so, despite dumbass Marg consistently rises in their ranks.

I studied the holocaust in depth in college in the 90‚Äôs but this has reading of transcripts from some of the trials, and it‚Äôs intense.

I‚Äôve seen so many people defend the Republican party‚Äôs handling of Greene

Like, holly shit. The Republican Party never punished her and barely ever spoke ill of her. The only time a few GOP members criticised her was when they also voted to protect her.

They support Greene. They are represented by Greene",-1,-1
11066,In case you were looking for proof that republicans don‚Äôt give a fuck about America.  <Rod Serling> Only in‚Ä¶The Twilight Zone.,-1,-1

11068,The Republican Party is turning into everything they tell their base they're fighting against. What a bunch of bitchy little hypocrites.,-1,-1
11069,Ocasio Cortez is correct. The gop don't care about antisemitism beyond promoting it.,-1,-1
11070,Republicans have been promising for years to remove Ilhan from the Foreign Affairs Committee since she first joined it. Because she is Muslim they actually  believe she is not loyal enough to America to sit in this important committee. this is purely anti Muslim action.,-1,-1
11071,Why should GOP condemn semitism? They're an openly fascist party.,-1,-1
11072,She screamed at the parents of mass shooting victims! That is on video. Wake up,-1,-1

Whatever side, she's got a good sense of what's going on and staffers that are on point.",-1,-1
11075,I want to see Republicans‚Äô response to this 1-minute speech by AOC that was 10x more inspiring than anything Kevin McCarthy has said in his tenure.,-1,-1
11076,AOC and Omar both tell truth to power and power hates them for their honesty and integrity.,-1,-1
11077,"But is Omar really antisemitic? Yes she did make negative comments against the Israeli government and some of their terrible actions throughout the years.  But I think most of what she said is quite fair.  She condemned the actions of many groups and governments. 

I'm against a lot of the actions that the US , Canadian and other various governments have committed over their history, does not mean I hate the whole race. 

Could she have chosen her words more carefully, probably. 

But when you compare what she says in contrast to the right, I would say it is pretty mild. 

I think an important question to ask is, is she making a difference in her role? This is how everyone in government should be judged, but sadly we just look at the R our the D, the right vs the left and ignore all else.

Edit to clarify government",-1,-1
11078,"And they refuse to oust a member who masqueraded as a descendent of Holocaust victims. 

AOC spitting straight fire once again.",-1,-1
11079,"And AOC's ""antisemitism"" was criticizing Israel for their actions in Palestine",-1,-1

11081,Bro I fkn hate Republicans,-1,-1
11082,"It was 100% because Ilhan is a strong independent black woman.

That scares the life out of the GOP because they know she has more of a spine than they ever will.",-1,-1
11083,"The thing is that this wasn't about antisemitic comments.  That was just a convenient excuse to hide their obvious racism.

They felt it was incredibly irresponsible to have a Muslim on the foreign affairs committee, cuz you know, she's friends with Al Qaeda and ISIS just simply due to her religion and skin color.  They see it as 1+1=2 because they're a bunch of fucking idiots.",-1,-1
11084,"I bet they laughed at these comments because they know how riduclous they, Republicans, are. They don't even care. AOC can make all the noise she wants. Republicans are getting exactly what they want so they literally don't give a shit. It's sad really. As long as power and money flows in their direction they'll happily keep taking the hits.",-1,-1
11085,Didn‚Äôt MTG also said the holocaust was a hoax anyways? AOC isn‚Äôt wrong,-1,-1
11086,"I disagree with AOC on a lot of things,  but you can't deny her wit.  This is awesome.",-1,-1
11087,Obviously it‚Äôs bullshit. But to understand this logic you have to agree the GQP sees every issue as an isolated one. Patterns be ignored unless helpful to their opinions,-1,-1
11088,"Republicans are hypocrites.

In other news water is wet.",-1,-1
11089,Amen.,-1,-1
11090,They really have no moral high ground anymore. Even if it was just an illusion before. They let the crazies in and now they are in control.,-1,-1
11091,"I really don't get Jews who vote Republican at this point. 

How much do they have to court the Nazi and white supremacist vote before you realize low taxes and supporting Israel aren't enough?",-1,-1
11092,Clowns all the way downtown while the GOP circus is around.,-1,-1
11093,I don‚Äôt want her near anything Jewish. Was she their best pick? The ‚ÄòJewish space laser‚Äô lady?,-1,-1
11094,Same old trick. Minorities always get blame for country's i issues,-1,-1
11095,"To be fair to MTG, after she first started making all the antisemitic statements McConnell made her give a press conference to placate some of the donors. At the conference MTG let every one know she recently learned the Holocaust was real and she thought it was bad. So she's totally not a bigoted piece of shit anymore. /s",-1,-1
11096,"I appreciate her calling out the BS. But it's all the low hanging fruit BS. She's got a platform because the Republicans have given her one by hating her so much, she should be using it to point out the other shit as well, the stuff that isn't just surface ""we're morons"" stuff. For instance and just something topical - how the Republicans have increased the debt more than Dems then won't agree to increase the debt ceiling when they can and Dem holds the WH. Or how Trumps tax cuts were permanent for the corps but expired for normal people to get it through.  Idk, maybe she does and those posts just don't get as much coverage. That also makes me sad lol.",-1,-1
11097,GOP has spent the better part of the past decade refusing to condemn hate groups. They've no leg to stand on.,-1,-1

11099,"Did anyone notice how Business Insider and general media continues to label AOC and her colleagues as the ‚Äúsquad,‚Äù but no labeling of the insurrectionists at large because they are whites.",-1,-1
11100,But having a Jewish Space Laser system is pro-Israel! /s,-1,-1
11101,Nothing republicans do or say is in good faith. doesn't even matter if they're lying or not,-1,-1

11103,The only standards they have are double standards,-1,-1
11104,I don‚Äôt like AOC but she‚Äôs right,-1,-1
11105,"I honestly dont know how AOC and others can stand to even be around these sick loons anymore. They walk into our congress while armed, spew nazi tropes, and spend all their time devising ways to hurt Americans and others.",-1,-1
11106,"Her whole speech/rebuttal/whathaveye was fire. She blasted them. She said they allowed the guy who threatened her with physical violence to get put on a committee, which is sickeningly true.",-1,-1

11122,I am not sure what a red wave in 2022 would have been like. This is still pretty bad.,-1,-1
11123,"AOC should have went with comparing vaccines to yellow stars, going with the billionaire space laser belief seems silly to those that don't pay attention to politics.",-1,-1
11124,"AOC is clever and correct, but misses the point that GOPers don‚Äôt care if you point out their hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is the new sacrament of the right.",-1,-1

11128,Perfect.,-1,-1
11129,I love AOC. She legit doesn‚Äôt give a fuck and calls them out on every single hypocrisy they spew.,-1,-1
11130,"Let‚Äôs be honest, AOC went in and was spot on.",-1,-1
11131,AOC is awesome.   She's so cool she's almost Canadian.,-1,-1
11132,"It's kinda wild how the GOP turned ""anti-Semitism"" from a phrase that mean 'anti-Jewish"" into one that means ""Doesn't blindly support the Israeli apartheid state.""",-1,-1
11133,"Dude!
This shit was savage!
I love AOC!
AOC for president!
Stick it to those racist assholes!",-1,-1
11134,"Without speaking to specifics, referring to any criticism of anyone who adheres to the Jewish religion or the Israeli state as antisemitism does a disservice to the overall effort to snuff out actual antisemitism in our society. Jewish people act erroneously and Israel does evil. Saying those things is not antisemitic.",-1,-1
11135,"As a Jew, can I politely point out that *both* Ilhan Omar and Margerie Taylor Greene have made a ton of antisemitic remarks?

I don't agree with removing Omar from her committee, and I'm a lifelong Democrat, but it does rub me the wrong way to have my people treated as pawns in all of this.

They found a bunch of harrassment and discrimination against Jews. Corbyn and his close allies are completely obsessed with Israel, to the point of it being bizarre and the only way it makes sense is if they hate Jews and want to use any point they can to attack them.

Luckily the current Labour leadership has purged most of the nasties out, so now they're leading the polls again. It does show that we need to stay vigilant against both the far left and the far right and their Jew hating conspiracies.

Well, Taylor Greene‚Äôs post suggested that the Rothschild banking firm is behind a supposed corporate cabal that engineered this whole space laser plot. Ah, of course, the old Rothschild family explanation again. As Zack Beauchamp wrote for Vox, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about the Rothschild family controlling the world have frequently surfaced in the past. Beauchamp explained that this was not ‚Äúan isolated anti-Semitic incident for Greene.‚Äù In fact, the Editorial Board for USA TODAY wrote that ‚Äúher Facebook account contained racist, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic views,‚Äù which doesn‚Äôt sound very nice. Beauchamp stated that Taylor Greene‚Äôs ‚Äúspace laser‚Äù theory is ‚Äúthe latest in a long line of conspiracies about the Rothschild family, and those conspiracies are always, at root, anti-Semitic: Since the 19th century, people have used claims that this one particular wealthy family controls the world to cast aspersions on Jews in general.‚Äù",-1,-1

Conservatism - in all times and places - is the political movement to protect aristocracy (intergenerational wealth and political power) which we now call oligarchs, and enforce social hierarchy. This hierarchy involves a morality centered around social status such that the aristocrat is inherently moral (an extension of the divinely ordained king) and the lower working class is inherently immoral. The actions of a good person are good. The actions of a bad person are bad. The only bad action a good person can take is to interfere with the hierarchy. All conservative groups in all times and places are working to undo the French Revolution, democracy, and working class rights. 

Populist conservative voter groups are created and controlled with propaganda. They wish to subjugate their local peers and rank people and don‚Äôt see the feet of aristocrats kicking them too.

Another way, Conservatives - those who wish to maintain a class system - assign moral value to people and not actions. Those not in the aristocracy are immoral and therefore deserve punishment.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agzNANfNlTs its a ret con

https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/conservatism.html

https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288 I like the concept of Conservatism vs. anything else.

*****
Most of my the examples are American, but conservatism is the same mission in all times and places. 

A Bush speech writer takes the assertion for granted: It's all about the upper class vs. democracy. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/06/why-do-democracies-fail/530949/ To paraphrase: ‚ÄúDemocracy fails when the Elites are overly shorn of power.‚Äù

Read here: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservatism/ and here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism#History and see that all of the major thought leaders in Conservatism have always opposed one specific change (democracy at the expense of aristocratic power). At some point non-Conservative intellectuals and/or lying Conservatives tried to apply the arguments of conservatism to generalized ‚Äúchange.‚Äù

Philosophic understandings include criticism. The Stanford page (despite taking pains to justify generalized/small c/populist conservatism) includes criticisms. Involving those, we can conclude generalized conservatism (small c) is a myth at best and a Trojan Horse at worst.

*****
Incase you don‚Äôt want to read the David Frum piece here is a highlight that democracy only exists at the leisure of the elite represented by Conservatism. 

>The most crucial variable predicting the success of a democratic transition is the self-confidence of the incumbent elites. If they feel able to compete under democratic conditions, they will accept democracy. If they do not, they will not.
And the single thing that most accurately predicts elite self-confidence, as Ziblatt marshals powerful statistical and electoral evidence to argue, is the ability to build an effective, competitive conservative political party before the transition to democracy occurs.

Conservatism, manifest as a political effort is simply the effort of the Elites to maintain their privileged status. Why is it that specifically Conservative parties nearly always align with the interests of the Elite? 

*****

There is a key difference between conservatives and others that is often overlooked. For non-conservatives actions are good, bad, moral, etc and people are judged based on their actions. For Conservatives, people are good, bad, moral, etc and the status of the person is what dictates how an action is viewed.

In the world view of the actual Conservative leadership - those with true wealth or political power - , the aristocracy is moral by definition and the working class is immoral by definition and deserving of punishment for that immorality. This is where the laws don't apply trope comes from or all you‚Äôll often see ‚Äúrules for thee and not for me.‚Äù The aristocracy doesn't need laws since they are inherently moral. Consider the divinely ordained king: he can do no wrong because he is king, because he is king at God‚Äôs behest. The anti-poor aristocratic elite still feel that way. 

This is also why people can be wealthy and looked down on: if Bill Gates tries to help the poor or improve worker rights too much he is working against the aristocracy and hierarchy.  

*****

If we extend analysis to the voter base: conservative voters view other conservative voters as moral and good by the state of being labeled conservative because they adhere to status morality and social classes. It's the ultimate virtue signaling. They signal to each other that they are inherently moral. It‚Äôs why voter base conservatives think ‚Äúso what‚Äù whenever any of these assholes do nasty anti democratic things. It‚Äôs why Christians seem to ignore Christ. 

While a non-conservative would see a fair or moral or immoral action and judge the person undertaking the action, a conservative sees a fair or good person and applies the fair status to the action. To the conservative, a conservative who did something illegal or something that would be bad on the part of someone else - must have been doing good. Simply because they can‚Äôt do bad.

To them Donald Trump is inherently a good person as a member of the aristocracy. The conservative isn‚Äôt lying or being a hypocrite or even being ""unfair"" because - and this is key - for conservatives past actions have no bearing on current actions and current actions have no bearing on future actions so long as the aristocracy is being protected. Lindsey Graham is ""good"" so he says to delay SCOTUS confirmations that is good. When he says to move forward: that is good.

To reiterate: All that matters to conservatives is the intrinsic moral state of the actor (and the intrinsic moral state that matters is being part of the aristocracy). Obama was intrinsically immoral and therefore any action on his part was ‚Äúbad.‚Äù Going further - Trump, or the media rebranding we call Mitt Romney, or Moscow Mitch are all intrinsically moral and therefore they can‚Äôt do ‚Äúbad‚Äù things. The one bad thing they can do is betray the class system. 


*****

The consequences of the central goal of conservatism and the corresponding actor state morality are the simple political goals to do nothing when large social problems arise and to dismantle labor & consumer protections. The non-aristocratic are immoral, inherently deserve punishment, and certainly don‚Äôt deserve help. They *want* the working class to get fucked by global warming. They *want* people to die from COVID19. Etc. 

Montage of McConnell laughing at suffering: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTqMGDocbVM&ab_channel=HuffPost

Months after I first wrote this it turns out to be validated by conservatives themselves: https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/16/trump-appointee-demanded-herd-immunity-strategy-446408

Why do the conservative voters seem to vote against their own interest? Why does /selfawarewolves and /leopardsatemyface happen? They simply think they are higher on the social ladder than they really are and want to punish those below them for the immorality. 

Absolutely everything Conservatives say and do makes sense when applying the above. This is powerful because you can now predict what a conservative political actor will do. 


*****


More familiar definitions of general/populist/small-c conservatism are a weird mash-up including personal responsibility and incremental change. Neither of those makes sense applied to policy issues. The only opposed change that really matters is the destruction of the aristocracy in favor of democracy. For some reason the arguments were white washed into a general ‚Äúopposition to change.‚Äù 

https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/democratic-administrations-historically-outperform-on-economy-by-j-bradford-delong-2020-10


 * This year a few women can vote, next year a few more, until in 100 years all women can vote?


 * This year a few kids can stop working in mines, next year a few more...


 * We should test the waters of COVID relief by sending a 1200 dollar check to 500 families. If that goes well we‚Äôll do 1500 families next month.


 * But it‚Äôs all in when they want to separate migrant families to punish them. It‚Äôs all in when they want to invade the Middle East for literal generations. 

The incremental change argument is asinine. It‚Äôs propaganda to avoid concessions to labor. 

The personal responsibility argument falls apart with the ""keep government out of my medicare thing."" Personal responsibility just means ‚ÄúI deserve free things, but people of lower in the hierarchy don‚Äôt.‚Äù

A nice quote:

>The policies of the Republicans in power have been exclusively economic, but the coalition has caused the social conservatives to be worse off economically, due to these pro-corporate policies. Meanwhile, the social issues that the ""Cons"" faction pushes never go anywhere after the election. According to Frank, ""abortion is never outlawed, school prayer never returns, the culture industry is never forced to clean up its act."" He attributes this partly to conservatives ""waging cultural battles where victory is impossible,"" such as a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. He also argues that the very capitalist system the economic conservatives strive to strengthen and deregulate promotes and commercially markets the perceived assault on traditional values.

And my response: 

Conservatism is the party that represents the aristocracy. The Republican Party has been the American manifestation of that. They‚Äôve courted uneducated, bigots, and xenophobes as their voter base. Their voter base is waking up to things and overpowering the aristocrats in the party. Which leaves us with a populist party whose drivers are purely bigotry and xenophobia. For some bizarre reason they latched onto Aristocrat Trump, mistaking his lack of manners (which is the only thing typical conservatives don‚Äôt like about him) for his not being a member of the elite.

The political terms Left and Right were first used in the 18th century, during the French Revolution, in reference to the seating arrangement of the French parliament. Those who sat to the right of the chair of the presiding officer (le pr√©sident) were generally supportive of the institutions of the monarchist Old Regime.[20][21][22][23] The original ""Right"" in France was formed in reaction to the ""Left"" and comprised those supporting hierarchy, tradition, and clericalism.[4]:693 The expression la droite (""the right"") increased in use after the restoration of the monarchy in 1815, when it was applied to the Ultra-royalists.[24]

Right-wing politics embraces the view that certain social orders and hierarchies are inevitable, natural, normal, or desirable,[1][2][3] typically supporting this position on the basis of natural law, economics, or tradition.[4]:693, 721[5][6][7][8][9] Hierarchy and inequality may be seen as natural results of traditional social differences[10][11] or competition in market economies.[12][13][14] The term right-wing can generally refer to ""the conservative or reactionary section of a political party or system"".[15]

According to The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought, the Right has gone through five distinct historical stages:[19]
1. The reactionary right sought a return to aristocracy and established religion.
2. The moderate right distrusted intellectuals and sought limited government.
3. The radical right favored a romantic and aggressive form of nationalism.
4. The extreme right proposed anti-immigration policies and implicit racism.
5. The neo-liberal right sought to combine a market economy and economic deregulation with the traditional right-wing beliefs in patriotism, elitism and law and order.[9][page needed]

In Great Britain, the Tory movement during the Restoration period (1660‚Äì1688) was a precursor to conservatism. Toryism supported a hierarchical society with a monarch who ruled by divine right. However, Tories differ from conservatives in that they opposed the idea that sovereignty derived from the people and rejected the authority of parliament and freedom of religion. Robert Filmer's Patriarcha: or the Natural Power of Kings (published posthumously in 1680, but written before the English Civil War of 1642‚Äì1651) became accepted as the statement of their doctrine.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism scroll down to Burke.

*****

So this article posits that ""Burke, conservatism‚Äôs ‚Äúmaster intellectual‚Äù, acknowledged by almost all subsequent conservatives."" "" was a lifelong student of the Enlightenment who saw in the French Revolution the ultimate threat to‚Ä¶modern, rational, libertarian, enlightened Whig values.‚Äù

We're also told ""Burke was ‚Äúless concerned with protecting the individual from the potential tyranny of the State, and more to protect the property of the few from the folly and rapacity of the many‚Äù""

The Plato page gives the abstract ""With the Enlightenment, the natural order or social hierarchy, previously largely accepted, was questioned."" And it also gives various versions of conservatism being pragmatic and not very theoretical or philosophical. Well what was the natural order, the few, and the social hierarchy, and traditional institutions, and traditions *to Burke* and to other conservative forefathers?

We also get the interesting tidbit ""Conservatives reject the liberal‚Äôs concept of abstract, ahistorical and universal rights, derived from the nature of human agency and autonomy, and possessed even when unrecognised..."" which undergirds the idea that *not everyone has or inherently deserves the same rights.* [I will editorialize here and argue that that conservative tenet is inherently at odds with the contemporary democracy of the developed world and our ideas of ""human rights."" It also falls right in line with my post discussing person vs. action based morality.]

We also find that upon reading Burke ""German conservatives adopted positions from reformism to reaction, **aiming to contain democratic forces**‚Äîthough not all of them were opposed to the Aufkl√§rung or Enlightenment. 

""Benjamin Disraeli (1804‚Äì81), founder of the essentially Burkean ‚ÄúOne Nation‚Äù conservatism, was a politician first, writer and thinker second. Disraeli never actually used the phrase ‚ÄúOne Nation‚Äù, but it was implied. The term comes from his 1845 novel Sybil; or the two nations, where Walter Gerard, a working-class radical, describes ‚ÄúTwo nations; between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy; who are as ignorant of each other‚Äôs habits, thoughts and feelings, as if they were dwellers in different zones, or inhabitants of different planets‚Ä¶The RICH and the POOR‚Äù. His aim was to unite these two nations through the benevolent leadership of the Conservative Party.""

And ""To reiterate, reaction is not Burkean conservatism, however. De Maistre (1753‚Äì1821) was a reactionary critic of reason, intellectuals and **universal rights.** Burke attacked the revolutionaries of 1789 ‚Äúfor the sake of traditional liberties, [Maistre] for the sake of **traditional authority**‚Äù (Viereck 2009: 191). 

Interestingly we also find ""According to Hegel, Rousseau‚Äôs contractual account destroys the ‚Äúdivine‚Äù element of the state (ibid.)."" This is clearly referring the idea that monarchies and surrounding wealthy people are divinely ordained to hold such power and wealth.

To reject the Enlightenment *as discussed* and to appeal to natural order, the few, and the social hierarchy, and traditional institutions, and traditions is to defend the ""landed nobility, monarchy and established church."" Even if not explicitly stated, those things are the spine of conservatism **as acted out**. The Plato page discussion of criticisms does a nice job refuting the incremental change aspects and so I won't repeat them.

If you push past the gluttony of abstraction and also read more primary Burke, et all. it is very clear that the traditional institution and authority being defended is the landed nobility. And that is still the unchanging goal.",-1,-1
11321,Damn thought you were popinkream for a sec,-1,-1
11322,"I think you are *mostly* correct, but I think there's a critical misunderstanding here:

> To the conservative, a conservative who did something illegal or something that would be bad on the part of someone else - must have been doing good. Simply because they can‚Äôt do bad.

I've observed that it's a bit more complex than this. It's not so much that conservatives think all other conservatives must be doing good - it's that they think only conservatives have the capacity to do good at all. The reason they think laws shouldn't apply to them isn't because they think their actions are automatically moral but because they don't think they deserve the same punishments as others, because they understand what they did wrong and won't do it again - and if they do do it again, well, they won't do it again next time, or the time after that... 

Conservatives have a strong sense of objective right and wrong. They understand that it's ""bad"" to get an abortion, but it's okay for a conservative woman to get one, because she understands it's bad and therefore can be trusted to not do it unless it's really necessary, which basically isn't even an abortion anyway right? They understand that it's bad when Trump cheats on his wife, it's just that Trump is a conservative, which means that he must have just made a mistake and is definitely really sorry so there's no need to judge him or ask for any accountability.

It is really not that hard to just look this shit up. The US constitution is not a long document.

You are a ""current"" Democrat, how did that translate to your voting in 2020? You dont need to say who, just how many Republicans you voted for.

11651,"There are many toxic behaviours now intimately associated with the modern Republican Party ‚Äî the often outrageous lies, the coverups and self-justification (especially of Trump's behaviour), the focus on hurting opponents, the nurturing of conspiracies, and the fomenting of violence. Is there a central cause to these? Some suggest they are natural result of a psychological type which is attracted to the party(e.g. the [""paranoid style""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paranoid_Style_in_American_Politics) or right wing authoritarianism) and thus perhaps inescapable. Others suggest the party is stuck in a toxic feedback loop that's nigh inescapable. Others seem to hold a theory that Republican behaviour is primarily strategy, albeit unethical, dictated by present circumstances (cf. if you can't win elections, reject democracy). 

So two questions: 

- What is your personal thesis around what motivates the behavioural pathology of the Republican Party? And, given your thesis:
- What, if anything, do you think it would take to make the Republican Party (apparatus, volunteer base, & elected officials) genuinely repent or seek to detox treatment?",-1,-1

How many of the GOP officials, in our experience, actually believe that here is ""socialism"" everywhere, and as a followup how many would you say would absolutely be behind another coup or overthrow if they lose the White House next year?

Would the current GOP, again in your experience working with them, start advocating for the ""other-izing"" of those of us with disabilities and other psychologies if it provided a scapegoat to attack? (I have been diagnosed with high functioning autism and have some experience with online right-wingers using in their comment fallacy games, and in-person times where I've thins about my appearance gave them something to hurt, like I am male and I have long hair because haircuts other me, so one guy once told me that I'd be sexually assaulted by 'South Central bangers"")

While they managed to take the House in 2022, it was only by a hair, and may not have even happened if NY/FL redistricted a little differently. On it's face, this seems like a huge, devastating red flag for them. What are they doing for future messaging?",-1,-1

The politics of this day and age are so extreme that I truly feel like conservatives and liberals are socially and culturally incompatible with each other, and the nation will somehow, someway, fracture as a result. They hate us, and we hate them. There is no room for compromise when it comes to human rights, and many in the GOP thrive on the suffering of those they see as lesser. Our younger generations are more depressed and angry than ever before because they see the world they are about to inherit and how powerless they are against corporate interests and increasingly pervasive socially regressive rhetoric on the right. Our founding document is old and out of touch with modern society, and changing it meaningfully is damn near impossible, and the only ones making a real effort to get a new constitutional convention together are the Republicans, who could only be doing so for nefarious, self-serving ideological purposes. Police continue to kill with near impunity, to the point the general consensus among Americans 30 and younger is that all cops are bad until something is done about the system itself. Government and corporate power are so entrenched now that peaceful protest doesn't work anymore because they know they can just wait it out. In short, I do not see a path forward for this country. Some days I feel like we're better off burning it all down and starting over from scratch, but that not only is not guaranteed to succeed and could very well backfire, but either way it would involve huge loss of life.

So my question is this: with everything wrong with politics, government, and corporatism, how can you possibly see a way forward for this country as a whole? Is there any way to heal the chasms splitting this world apart, or is fracture inevitable?",-1,-1

My personal preference would've been to unpack the Supreme Court (and lower courts: more circuits, and more seats at both the trial and appellate levels) while there was a Democratic trifecta. Get a liberal majority on the Supreme Court, who can then put an end to gerrymandering, dark money, actual and constructive voter disenfranchisement, shut down ISLT before it's allowed to take root, etc.

But, obviously, that ship has sailed. Where do you see things heading? Any blind spots you think Democrats are missing? What's the way out with a captured judiciary that's unconstrained and a captured party in Congress unwilling to impose any constraints on the judiciary?

Unrelated, but if you're up to it: what do you think should/will be the resolution of the pending debt limit showdown? Will the GOP crash the US/global economies to extract concessions? Will they blink? Assuming they're on a kamikaze mission, what's your preferred resolution? Trillion dollar coin(s)? Arguing the 14th Amendment takes precedence over the statutory debt limit and continuing to service the debt anyway? Letting the GOP get its way and owning the fallout?

Assuming the GOP isn't bluffing, my personal preference would be to argue the debt limit is unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment and do away with it once and for all as a weapon to be wielded against Democrats.",-1,-1

11683,"It‚Äôs a combination of a few things, the overriding points being 1. Siege mentality, 2. Career advancement 3. Some believe him on some stuff and don‚Äôt care about the stuff he is lying about.  
  
1.So the extreme right-wing of the GOP has a persecution complex, and like their base voters, they view Trump as a fighter who will push back on all the ‚Äúleft-wing lies‚Äù. They overlook the bullshit because he‚Äôs their fighter. The vile things he says about his opponents? They love that. He is finally the one that is going to bring the pain to the liberals. That‚Äôs how he takes advantage of this siege mentality.   
  
2. Career advancement is pretty self-explanatory. Most politicians believe they are destined for higher office or advancement, and they see this as an opportunity. And for many, Mike Pompeo I am looking at you, this has worked out.   
  
3. Some believe a lot of what Trump is selling. I am not a psychologist. But when you start rationalizing stuff and remain in a thought bubble of like-minded people pushing you into more extreme ideas, it would stand to reason that you slowly begin believing these ideas.",-1,-1

The average American voter works more than 40 hours a week, has responsibilities outside of work and their time off, and has hobbies they enjoy outside of politics. 

For people not super passionate about politics, they aren't following things very closely. 

Generally speaking, I believe that if a set of choices is made clear to the voters, they will be smart enough to pick the right choice. Its a principle from my favorite philosopher Montesquieu -- although he was talking about ""the people"" in general.

I do think we see what a productive GOP can look like on policy --- albeit these were Democrat initiatives. But there was Bipartisan support for an infrastructure bill.

Why did I work for the GOP?

I thought that I could impact the GOP from the inside out and held economic views on trade, the military and America's standing in the world that were similar to the establishment GOP in 2014.

I went into working for a Tea Pary guy as a policy advisor and shifted his policy significantly toward the center ... He was the 218th vote on Obama's largest second-term agenda item, Trade promotion Authority. While he still said stupid shit, I also toned down his rhetoric.

Podcast is center left because of the perspective I bring, the guests we host and the topics we cover. I am very socially liberal. The things I describe are largely the things I think people would be interested in hearing in a reddit ama.

I was also a DEMOCRAT political appointee for the Governor of Puerto Rico and managed a $90 billion appropriations request to rebuild that island. And I pushed for statehood. I just doubt people are interested in this or how legislation gets passed.

My thesis is that its a combination of a feedback loop that you mention from the media, and their grassroots activists, the impact of money in politics (both koch brothers style and MTG small donors), and a lot of the base voters and extreme right-wing politicians having a siege mentality. Two podcast episodes we discuss this in I point you to.

There are major disagreements on when we can start tracking the current iteration of the GOP right-wing. I believe that to be 2008 financial crisis and the Koch Brothers setting up their Tea Party grassroots network. That's where I think the modern day cutoff should begin. 

Solution? Massive electoral losses so that these politicians learn that elevating culture wars, and extreme rhetoric painting Democrats as your enemy will not win nationally. Only when rock bottom has been hit can the establishment attempt to regain influence. But even then, its really difficult with gerrymandering.",-1,-1

The short answer on Trump‚Äôs rise   
  
1.	National celebrity   
2.	Media elevation  
3.	It was the cycle of the outsider, aka people weren‚Äôt too keen on career politicians   
4.	Trump had an acerbic demeanor, which is what the Tea Party voters and activists LOVED.  
5.	Trump‚Äôs policies, protectionist, xenophobic, etc were aligned with the Tea Party   
6.	In primaries, the grassroots activists have a lot of sway in specific states, so he quickly carved out a sizeable base   
  
He changed the party by further elevating the Tea Party and their ideas, which had been relatively a fringe movement of extremists.   
  
Regarding how politicians viewed Trump when he was running vs after he won. Many of them largely thought Trump was a vile buffoon. They initially came out against him. When he became President, these criticisms moved to behind closed doors and they viewed him as a vessel to accomplish their policy priorities, or to manipulate into career advancement.",-1,-1
11698,"Well, this is really broad. Can we dig into this a bit more? 

Older generation as in elected officials in the 90s and the oughts? Or older currently elected officials?",-1,-1
11699,"It is a massive red flag for them.

I think its important to note that demographic trends in politics don't always go in a straight line, if they did, Texas would be blue. I know you did not say this, but I think its important to note.

In short, the GOP is paralyzed. So they are doing nothing. The GOP elites want to move past Trump to DeSantis, but I don't think this is likely in 2024.

In addition to Trump still having an outsized impact. The House Freedom Caucus now, for all practical purposes, controls the House. So they will be driving national coverage of legislation over the next 2 years which is a major problem for the GOP. 

Add in the [right-wing media ecosystem](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/is-right-wing-media-poisoning-the-gop-with-matt-k/id1585080352?i=1000596254313), and the party is stuck. 

They are in a very difficult position of their own making and I only see a resounding defeat being able to shift their approach to politics moving forward.",-1,-1
11700,"I don't.

Trump has a core following that will be difficult for anyone to overcome in a primary.

DeSantis is also a weird guy that lacks charisma. He's only been having interviews with friendly media and giving speeches. Very closely controlled public appearances. 

According to Florida reporters and politicos, I've spoken with, DeSantis also is somewhat paranoid and largely only trusts his wife as a political advisor. 

I think Trump attacks him and destroys him on the debate stage, IF DeSantis runs.

11701,"This is a great question. The Congressman I worked for was from the Kansas 1st. So I spent a lot of time with these voters. 

Short answer is that there is a lot of groupthink out there because its an overwhelmingly conservative area. To go a bit deeper, the GOP does a really great job of painting the entire Democratic party as in-line with the most unpopular Members of the party -- think AOC and Rep. Omar. Finally, the rightwing media ecosystem really distorts perceptions. If you listen to Hannity and the Erick Erickson types all day, you are going to have a siege mentality and hate the Democrats.  

Here is the thing. When you discuss policy with these folks, there is a lot of common ground. Most don't want the police armed to the teeth, most don't want the cops murdering black men. 

However, the branding by the GOP of socialism, and the elevation of the more unpopular Members of the Dem party creates a strong aversion to most Democrats.",-1,-1

11738,"> I think that we are being overly broad here as the GOP isn't just one faction. 

Well, there are some theories that try to be broad, and others such as yours, which tend to break down the system into components that interact in a particular way. I was just trying to give a few examples to frame the question. But personally I tend to agree with the influence of several components you ID, including ""the impact of money in politics"". 

One component you've left out ‚Äî perhaps for good reason, or perhaps you just identify it differently ‚Äî might be the apparent merger of the Trump faction and conspiracy theorists. IMO that's played an important role in the entrenchment of their ""painting Democrats as your enemy"", because now to them, dems are ""lizard people"" or a ""secret cabal"". Before Trump's tenure, I'd found a more equitable distribution of conspiracy believers on the left-right axis. But now, or since about 2016, it seems that, they have polarized. I'd point to the foundational roles of troll-farms, Q, 4chan, and certain Reddit communities in birthing what is now a loosely unified conspiracy movement with its own political figure at the centre. 

Looking back, in US elections I've observed prior to 2016, there's never been such a central and reoccurring role for conspiracy theories or ideologies. They seem to be a ""grassroots movement"" but without the standard corporate institutional backing (or AstroTurfing aspects) that you'd find with the [Tea Party movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement). 

**So, do you see a role of the conspiracy element, or is that just part of the ""siege mentality"" which you cite? Is it different from the Tea Party network or more of the same?**

I haven't listened to your podcast before, but I'll add those two episodes to the queue. 

> learn that elevating culture wars, and extreme rhetoric painting Democrats as your enemy will not win nationally

Curiously, many on the right use what seems to be a thought terminating clich√© in answer to that: Candidate X lost ""because he wasn't Trumpy enough!"" I fear ideas like that might prevent learning. 

I'd also question whether there can really be an ability to ""learn"" if and when one's core support comes primarily from those with deeply counterfactual belief systems. Those who confront the beliefs are at risk of being primaried and exchanged for a worse option.

> Only when rock bottom has been hit can the establishment attempt to regain influence. But even then, its really difficult with gerrymandering.

Another system that I fear might parallel this is viruses in the natural environment. Many viruses circulate in Species A until that species builds up immunity, at which point the virus gets wiped out by lack of hosts. However that virus often has [another host, Species B, which acts as a reservoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_reservoir), from which it will eventually re-emerge to begin infecting Species A anew. 

Gerrymandered districts, or even ""red states"" likely tend to act as reservoirs. Gerrymandering itself might not be enough to achieve truly ""massive electoral losses"" unless first past the post is also eliminated.

Criminal justice reform is a nice buzzword phrase, what actual reforms can you name that you support?

I never knew that stricter gun control (again, nice buzzword phrase with no actual policy stance behind it to explain what that buzzword is supposed to mean) and supporting living wages or conditions that might almost be...livable (unless you live in say, Flint MI or Jackson MS) were equality or dignity issues. Perhaps you could have mentioned how you feel about the rise of drag legislation or trans rights issues or what you are doing (or support) to protect communities who find themselves literally under fire, by people you helped influence with the GOP's constant promotion of 'guns everywhere' and 'trans = evil' philosophies?

You almost made a legitimate policy stance with the environment. Yet, you somehow completely managed to state any actual definable approaches other than ""i'm ok with what the other guys already did"", even after dealing with an immense natural disaster...

""Supporting institutions"" isn't really a common democratic standard talking point, its just being a decent human who understands what it means to be living in a functional society.

Maybe update your talking points?

I provided you with topics, didn‚Äôt know you wanted a white paper. I can expound more on this, but I‚Äôm just giving a few examples. And simply put, outside of a few outliers, no elected GOP official supports the below policies. 

1. Criminal justice reform ‚Äî for starters would be to eliminate mandatory minimums. Second, remove qualified immunity for police officers. Third legalize MJ and immediately let folks out of prison for non-violent MJ crimes. 

2. I totally oppose anti-trans legislation. And think politicians demonizing the community are trash. 

3. Gun control ‚Äî I believe Heller is an abomination of a decision, and that we need strict red-flag laws where states not implementing them lose federal funding. I also believe in banning assault weapons and the such. I think there should be a mandatory licensing program, like we have for cars. I also believe that gun makers should be liable. 

4. Expanding the public option is a pretty damn straight forward policy response.

5. Immigration ‚Äî support a pathway to citizenship for people here that have no violent criminal record. Also support increasing number of legal immigrants per year, and streamlining the process to reduce wait times. I fully support expanding the H1b and H2a visa programs. 

6. I support positive economic incentives for transitioning our economy over to green energy. So that‚Äôs subsidies to increase manufacturing of related products and adoption of technologies. I support multilateral agreements to advance climate change, like the Paris accords. It‚Äôs important to promote a smooth transition regarding our production, and I believe that is done through making renewables more affordable. I also believe small businesses, homes, etc, should get some type of tax credits for switching to renewable. I‚Äôm pro-nuclear, and understand that this is contentious. When I spoke with Van Jones on a show he was ‚Äúnuclear agnostic‚Äù There‚Äôs a significant number of other policies I support on this issue as well, I‚Äôm not here to write a policy paper.",-1,-1

Nina Turner is not a media figure. She's an organizer and progressive activist and has barely been relevant in the past few years.

I feel like its the opposite and we're already getting a glimpse of it.  The tRump candidates went down in flames but all these ""moderate"" Republicans actually did quite well.  Yet what happened as soon as the ""moderates"" were sworn in?  They fall right in line with the the worst Republicans because they have no spine.

I say we stop pretending there's such a thing as a moderate Republican and just work to stop them instead of thinking we can make them better people.",-1,-1

It erases the actual problem (policies of the Israeli government that harm Palestinians) and replaces it with a national *identity*. Criticizing Israel's policies acknowledges that they can and should be changed. But if Israel is an Apartheid state, it cannot change while remaining Israeli; that's simply what it *is*. In other words, you have no recourse but to destroy the state. Which, oddly, also mirrors what the Israeli far-right claims (that they can't make the reforms necessary to ensure the Palestinians' peace and security because it would constitute national suicide) AND what Hamas claims (that they will not accept any outcome other than Israel's total destruction). It also erases the possibility of a two-state solution, wherein Palestinians have a state that is uniquely theirs, because in the Apartheid analogy, Apartheid was dismantled by creating a unitary south African state. But the historical context there was completely different (I could list the reasons but this is getting long-winded already); suffice it to say that it's a very round peg in a very square hole.

This was the same guy who ate the raw onion (skin still on!!!) and got called a misogynist by a female PM, you may have heard of him.

We had a full on white supremacist (Fraser Anning, who was an apologist for the 2019 Christchurch shooter) get elected, but it was only due to a weird technicality, and he lost his seat a couple years later. Interestingly, he was descended from station owners (ranchers) who massacred Aboriginals.

This year, we are going to have a referendum on a constitutional amendment.

The amendment would guarantee that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders can choose non-voting representatives that could speak in Parliament on Indigenous issues, especially when the government is going to make a law or policy specifically targeted at them.

The process to get to this, was roughly bipartisan with a bit of feet-dragging on the conservative side but more or less bipartisan.

But lately a lot of racists have come out of the woodwork, as the referendum has drawn closer.

IMO there is more casual racism in Australia than there is in the USA, but the USA has more extreme racists.

Just yesterday, there was a funeral for Cardinal George Pell.

He was the 3rd highest ranking Catholic in the world, and he spent decades of his life covering up child abuse by priests under his authority. He bribed and threatened victims and their families into silence, while moving the rapist priests to different parishes, so they could continue to abuse kids. People like him are the reason we had to make it illegal to not report child abuse.

He famously said that abortion was a worse moral failing than priests abusing children (he also said climate change was false, and refused to serve communion to LGBT people).

Tony Abbott, John Howard (conservative PM from 1996-2007) were both there along with the current leader of the Opposition (Peter Dutton, leader of the Liberal Party ... who are actually conservatives) and other well-known right wing Aussies.

12006,"It is because conservatism (from ***any*** country) has 1 and only 1 true ideal: the preservation of an aristocracy. A major component of this leads to a very different view of morality.

For people who are liberal or left-leaning, it is ***actions*** that deem whether someone is moral. If someone lies constantly, or is hypocritical or, worse, is a sex offender or fraudster etc. A Liberal or left-wing person would view that person as having done something bad. If they continue to do this, they will be considered a bad person - as they keep doing bad things. 

Conversely, for people who are conservative, it is ***people*** that deem whether actions are moral. If someone is a good person, then what they do is also good. This is how Trump can lie and steal and not be considered bad, or Gaetz can be a sex offender and not be considered bad, or Santos can be a fraudster and not be considered bad... these people are Republicans and, therefore, are deemed ""good people"". So, what they do *must* be good. If anyone says any different, it is because they are fools, or liars themselves, or because they want to undermine good people to help bad people (where democrats are considered 'bad'). This stems from the Divine Right theory of monarchs and conservatism is purely a continuation of Divine Right, albeit cloaked in other verbiage. 

This is why, according to conservatives, simply being LGBT (which, in their mind, is equivalent to being a bad person) is enough by itself to lead to accusations of grooming or other heinous crimes. But, if they have actual Republican politicians who have been very, very credibly accused of being groomers/sex pests (e.g., Roy Moore)... that doesn't matter.

In 2017, Trump divulged classified information to russian ""diplomats"" during a meeting in the white house.

He didnt steal the information, it was already in his head.  He didnt misplace it, he knew what he was saying was classified.  It wasnt locked away safe.  It made it's way into adversarial possession when he blurted it out.

His excuse was as president, he can declassify anything he wants.

Why the free pass on Trump for actually divulging (not simply improperly storing, but a step further by sharing) classified information?

Yes, the President of the United States has broad authority to declassify certain kinds of information. However, the decision to go so must be memorialized and all relevant agencies must be notified as to which specific documents have been declassified. Until the process is completed, the information is still classified. Sharing classified information is still a crime whether it‚Äôs shared by a President or not.",-1,-1

12151,"I keep having to explain this. 

The OP specifically asked why Trump got a pass when he divulged classified information to Russian diplomats. My response is specific to that situation because, as POTUS he is allowed to blab about classified information. He didn't give the diplomats documents or anything of that nature. He told them information that he had gleaned from classified documents. 

Again, this is allowed and not the same as the issues he is facing now in mishandling the classified documents.",-1,-1

So, if Hunter Biden is selling potentially confidential documents from Joe Biden, it's ok because he's a private citizen?  And if Joe Biden is potentially receiving payment, also no big deal, because Hunter is a private citizen. Got it.  No need to investigate.",-1,-1
12153,I wasn't trying to excuse anything.  I was merely stating classified doesn't mean it has our nations secrets.  The nature of the documents is more important.

You've made fallacious arguments based on ignorance and you want to risk lives on the ground by shooting down a large object and letting it crash on who-knows-what.

Just exactly how are you being a good American in this matter?",-1,-1
12274,">These balloons can scan more territory than a satellite because of its low speed. It is a violation of international law and an invasion of US airspace. 

Can you show me how this is a violation of int'l law - under what treaty? It's up several tens of thousands of feet higher in the sky than even spy craft typically fly, and there's no int'l law regarding how high up a country owns the sky. If this is illegal then so are commercial satellites and meteorological tools that are used every day globally. 

Sending a drone would've been both harder to trace and easier to direct, and would have had a much lower altitude. The balloon is basically a low orbit satellite itself so you can't argue oh its so much closer than spy satellites either. Elon Musk is flying thousands of low orbit surveillance-capable satellites over China right now so that people can get WiFi and I don't see them whining about it. For that matter, the Chinese government can just send a Chinese citizen to Montana to probe around if they want to - which they have been caught doing several times, with no real consequences, so why would they change their tactic up to be more complicated, draw more attention, and be less effective? A balloon is impossible to direct even under the best circumstances when it's 10-20 miles in the sky.",-1,-1
12275,">I think almost every American wants that balloon popped including myself.

The reason they won't pop the balloon is once they do, they'll have to admit it's just a university research project or a civilian meteorologist's property. Because it'll hit the ground and we'll be able to recover whatever devices are on it and they won't be that exciting. So long as it stays in the sky, everyone can claim its ""mysterious and threatening"" and make a big deal of it.",-1,-1
12276,"> they are in development

They aren't though. A prototype isn't even designed yet. It's just words on paper, which isn't real development.

If you know anything about the US military, this project will likely get scrapped before it makes it to a prototype. They come up with thousands of ideas a year, and *maybe* go on to actually develop a couple dozen of the bigger ideas. Because oftentimes once you actually test a hypothesis and build a prototype, it's realized that a ground breaking idea is actually a broken idea. Seeing as the last word spoken about combat balloons was over two years ago, I think they've moved on from this idea.",-1,-1

In a blunt speech last Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the central bank's battle against inflation won't come without some casualties.

The Fed is firmly resolved to bring down inflation and to ""keep at it until the job is done,"" Powell said. But that plan ‚Äî which involves a series of hefty interest rate hikes ‚Äî will bring ""some pain to households and businesses,"" he acknowledged.

""What [Powell] calls 'some pain,' means putting people out of work, shutting down small businesses because the cost of money goes up, because the interest rates go up.""

Assuming there's no change in the labor force participation rate, every 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate translates to a loss of around 1.6 million jobs, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. So if the United States suffers a typical recession, where joblessness hovers at around 6%, that would amount to about 5 million jobs, he said.

Even if the Fed were to revise its inflation target from 2% to 3%, it would still need to slow the economy to the point where roughly 1.7 million jobs are lost, according to an analysis from RSM released Monday. That would translate to the unemployment rate rising from today's 3.5% to 4.6%.

""That is about as close as one may get to what can charitably be called a soft landing,"" RSM economists Joe Brusuelas and Tuan Nguyen wrote in the report. However, ""while a soft landing would be an optimal outcome, resetting the inflation target from the flexible target of 2% it announced two years ago would hurt the Fed's credibility,"" they noted.",-1,-1

Obama/Biden were definitely trying to be fair. It was a key reason why he picked Biden and it was a campaign promise and the GOP resisted. Romney even tried to distance himself from the health care bill. At the end of the term having been told that Russia was trying to influence the election he decided to bring McConnell and I think Paul Ryan to seek their opinions on how to proceed. His concern was it might influence the election against Trump, they agreed and decided with the course of action we all saw in 2016.

12835,"i cant speak for the mary part of the catholic church as im not catholic but worshipping the crucifix is an easy one. Back in the older days of the faith, they changed symbols constantly that meant different meanings depending on where they are adopted from. At one point the faith used a pentagram due to its spiritual connection to the elements and the human soul. In response, an inverted pentagram came to exist as an anti church protest symbol. response? they made the inverted pentagram a satanic symbol. You see the same treatment of the Cross and inverted cross. Different Crosses have been used by different sects, some of which were denounced by each other. The Ichthys or jesus fish is just another symbol adopted by a Jesus oriented faith even though its origins date back to the  2nd century, its gotten more popular in the modern day due to the darker nature of the cross. It was actually used BEFORE the cross/crucifix was adopted, around the 11th century and really took off in the 14th. So they didnt really start that whole crucifix shit till a good 1000 years after jesus, most likely as a form of intimidation and control.

The old faiths were heavy in sacrificial and morbid worship and claimed jesus' blood was one of purity. This is why they chose the crucifix as it was literally coated in the blood of Christ. Its a form of sacramental seeing as it was 'blessed' by the blood of Christ. The shroud of turin was also an item that was worshipped until it's dated orgin was found to be a fake, among other items like the lance the roman knight Longinus who stabbed jesus in the rib, though again its another item that has been denounced by the faith in more recent years.

In short, the Catholics are super heavy on idol worship and aren't against stealing or outright lying, Something that is VERY not cash money from jesus' viewpoint. something most modern day Catholics eventually find out if they question the faith. Its all about control and manipulation. Though wheres theres a will theres a way and plenty of denominations exist today to cater to whoever you want to listen to, though ill remind those reading this of [Ezekiel 34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2034&version=NET).

If you look at Old Testament God, you'll see one that could be swayed from wrath, particularly in the case of Sodom and Gomorrah, if at least 10 righteous people could be found.  You can also look at the story of Job for another example where God was willing to be a little flexible in some ways.

In the New Testament, the only example immediately coming to mind is when Jesus is being crucified and he pleads with God to forgive those crucifying him ""for they know not what they do"", which seems to imply God is at least able to be moved by pleas and prayers in some cases.

As for Mary, I'm not sure if there's a documented example in church history where God changed his mind becasue of her (but I could be forgetting).  You might find examples where someone asked for Mary's intercession and their prayers were later answered, particularly in cases where she is alleged to have appeared to one or more people.

In all of this though, I think we have to come back to the idea that Catholics do believe in free will.  Where there's free will, there are things for which one might plea/pray to God for intervention.  And if that's the case, mightn't asking the Saints or Mary to pray to God on one's behalf not amplify one's need a little louder?",-1,-1

The other brief examples i gave did untold harm to many hundreds of thousands of people over the better part of a few hundred years, but they would of found a reason to inflict harm on them regardless during that era. Many of them are slowly regaining their good following as the truth has become more common. While the jesus fish had very little significance to the greeks, its modern day use seems largely unnecessary with its resurgence due to all the symbols that they have adopted over the millennias. It just feels like marketing and kind of tarnishes the symbol's legacy and its importance, but its not my church or faith so i suppose they can do as they see fit.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthys)

to quote ""In the 1970s the ""Jesus Fish"" started to be used as an icon of modern Christianity. In 1973 the symbol and message was taken to the Aquarius Rock Festival in Nimbin, Australia. Today, it can be seen as a decal or emblem on the rear of automobiles or as pendants or necklaces as a sign that the owner is a Christian. Versions of this include an Ichthys with ""Jesus"" or ""ŒôŒßŒòŒ•Œ£"" in the centre, or simply the Ichthys outline by itself.\[24\] According to one writer, while many Christians hang a cross necklace or rosary inside their vehicles, ""the fish sticker on the car is a more conscious symbol of a witnessing Christian‚Äîsignificantly, unlike the former, it is on the outside of the car for everyone to see.""

""It has been speculated that the symbol was adopted by early Christians as a secret symbol; a shibboleth to determine if another was indeed Christian.""

The irony is, the symbol appears to be adopted as to serve the exact OPPOSITE of its original purpose. It was originally used as a 'hide in plain sight', now its being used as a symbol of 'everyone will know what faith i follow'.",-1,-1

I totally agree about the swastika, what a shame to have such a beautiful symbol tarnished by evil.  I hope time straightens that out.  Not enough time has happened because not enough has changed to remove that tarnish, unfortunately.

Symbols change meaning with the circumstances that surround them.  Often the meaning is reversed over time.  Look at what the rightwing is doing to language right now in real time for examples.

Of course, there's always the chance it could continue one for some time even with holes in it and land where people are.

Or you know just let it keep floating past the USA and let Europe deal with it. This balloon could be on track for a new high score speed run. I don't think anyone has actually said what kind of meteorological stuff it is studying.

But the current plan is to shoot it down and recover when it hits the Atlantic so I'm kinda bummed. I'd really like to find out what it was doing before it gets shot down. More so than it's a weather balloon. It's got a lot of solar panels and supposedly a ""technology bay"" which someone said was revolutionary.",-1,-1

The balloon is not a threat. If we shoot it down it becomes a threat. Even though a very small threat it would still become a threat. Whereas now, it is not a threat.

Fun Fact: In [Johnson v. Johnson](https://law.justia.com/cases/rhode-island/supreme-court/1995/654-a-2d-1212.html), a woman sued her ex-husband after he called her a whore in a crowded restaurant in Cranston, RI. 

For his defense, the man argued that his ex-wife was, in fact, a whore.

In the ruling, the judge went out of his way to note that the plaintiff was, inarguably, *an actual whore*.  But, he continued, that fact was not a sufficient defense, as the man‚Äôs intent in saying so in a public venue was intended to harm her reputation.

I know it sounds like I‚Äôm just making shit up, but here‚Äôs the ruling, verbatim:

>There's no question in the court's mind, as suggested by Mr. Keough, that she was not of virtuous character and that she perhaps fit all of those descriptions of a whore that was given to the jury. But nonetheless, be she a whore or not, she's entitled to the protections of the law, and the law is clear and the law is that while truth is a defense, if it is uttered maliciously, it is then actionable, and that's what happened here. So that when I'm reminded of my definition of what a whore is, those definitions are all from decided cases and they all fit the plaintiff, there's no question about it; but so does the constitutional prohibition and the protection that she has, and that is that one cannot be slandered maliciously.""",-1,-1

13043,"**From reporter Marianna Sotomayor:**

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) was kicked off the House Foreign Affairs Committee in a party-line vote that followed a contentious debate on the House floor Thursday morning that included yelling and Omar defending herself on the verge tears.

House Republicans had set their sights on removing Omar after she had made what Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) recently described as ‚Äúrepeated antisemitic and anti-American remarks‚Äù throughout her time as a member of the House. The resolution, once adopted, would explicitly condemn Omar for using an antisemitic trope to suggest Israel‚Äôs allies in U.S. politics were motivated by money rather than principle when she in 2019 tweeted, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about the Benjamins baby.‚Äù

The resolution also disapproves of Omar‚Äôs critiques of Israel and her comparison of actions by the United States to those of terrorist groups. She later clarified those comments, saying, ‚ÄúI was in no way equating terrorist organizations with democratic countries with well-established judicial systems.‚Äù

Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), while noting that Omar has made mistakes, forcefully defended her in a Thursday morning news conference, saying: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going to take place on the floor today is not a public policy debate. It‚Äôs not about accountability. It‚Äôs about political revenge.‚Äù

Omar, a refugee from Somalia, is one of the first Muslim women to serve in the House of Representatives and often faces death threats and other threats of violence. Her office told The Post that violent threats had increased considerably since she has been in the news again. On Wednesday, Omar tweeted an expletive-laden voice mail she received this week in which a man said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll put a bullet in your f------ head and get the f--- out of my country.‚Äù

‚ÄúThese threats increase whenever Republicans put a target on my back,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúThey can continue to target me, but they will never stop me from fighting for a more just world.‚Äù

13112,"""New McCarthyism"".

One may not always agree with Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who has made some troubling statements in the past, in my humble opinion, but she does have 1) the right to free speech, and 2) the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.

To call decisions, policies, and/or practices of the State of Israel into question is not *de facto* anti-semitism, in my humble opinion.  There is no state in the world that is above being called to account, whether by its own citizens or the citizens of another country.  Anti-semitism moves beyond mere questioning and calling to account, and is motivated by baseless hatred.

Even if one agrees that certain statements made by Ilhan Omar about the State of Israel are of legitimate concern, her removal from the Foreign Affairs Committee smacks of racism and partisan ""witch-hunt"" tactics, being fueled by a male Speaker against a fellow member of the House who is a woman belonging to both an ethnic and religious minority in our country.

Ilhan Omar has been forcibly removed from the Foreign Affairs Committee for statements which she has made about the State of Israel, while Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) believes in ""Jewish Space Laser"" conspiracies, yet continues to sit on the Oversight and Homeland Security Committees...

...and even more egregious, George Santos (R-NY) continues to occupy a seat in the House of Representatives which was fraudulently won...

This is my opinion as a Jewish woman of color who loves the State of Israel, who is working for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and who is an Independent voter and concerned citizen born in the United States of America.",-1,-1
13113,I don't recall anything she has said about Israel or the US that was untrue.,-1,-1
13114,Israel is a welfare state. I thought the GOP hates ‚Äúhandouts‚Äù . Israel need to pull out itself by the bootstraps and stop relying on free handouts.,-1,-1

13116,"Absolute bullshit, GOP is rotten to its core!",-1,-1
13117,"She'll be back on committee in 2024 when Democrats retake the House. It's whatever. 

Republicans have accomplished nothing",-1,-1
13118,"While I disagree with republican motives regarding her removal I do have my own problems with how she's acted as a representative and committee member. 

For starters she voted ""present"" on a bill back in 2019 that would have acknowledged and condemned Turkey for the Armenian genocide, along with sanctions against Turkey for supporting militia groups in Syria that were targeting Kurds. While her statement regarding her decision wasn't completely without merit. She should have still voted yes if she truly believed in her commitment to human rights abuses, that's not to say she couldn't have complained about why the bill was introduced, but to vote present merely out of a concern for politics seems quite underwhelming for someone who claims to be concerned with human rights abuses. 

My next concern is one of the organizations she said should investigate and charge US personnel with war crimes instead of American Courts. Now I don't have a problem with this idea on the surface, especially with laws like the ""The Hague Invasion Act,"" and I don't have a problem with her pointing out that there are and have been war crimes committed by US troops. My concern is more with the organization she said that should charge these accused war criminals with. The International Criminal Court shouldn't be the overseer of such cases when they refuse to [even investigate a genocide going on in China.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/15/world/asia/icc-china-uighur-muslim.html) If this organization is going to play geopolitics in favor of some nations but not others than they have no right to investigate human rights violations when they're playing favoritism. 

I don't know if these concerns should be enough for her dismissal as a committee member, however, I do think she should be called out on biases and geopolitical favoritism, especially if it doesn't reflect on what congress believes regarding its own foreign policy considering she is/was a committee member but that's just me.",-1,-1

In fact, Republicans spend a considerable amount of their time and energy doing just that, finding ways to justify their inherently discriminatory or suppresive measures. 

They'll disguise it as some noble achievement or some counterrevolutionary effort, thus indulging their voter's sense of ""patriotism"", but a vast majority of the time it's either a double standard, or it's part of some ""stick it to the libs"" vindictive crusade, both steeped in a deep-rooted sense of entitlement and a growing right-wing chauvinism.

I mean, you're not wrong.

Largely a consequence of partisan gerrymandering at the state level.

Of the top 4 most populous states in the country, 122/144 races are non-competitive:

* 44 of California's 52 House districts are non-competitive
* 35 of Texas' 38 House districts, non-competitive
* 25 of Florida's 28 House districts, non-competitive
* 18 of New York's 26 House districts, non-competitive

And the ratio is even worse in the less populated states. Just 15% of House races across the country *aren't already in the bag.* In any election, that's about 60 of 435 total House seats that aren't already decided. That's a travesty in a ""democracy"". And due to gerrymandering and the capped seat count, Republicans don't even need to get a majority of total votes in order to get a majority of seats.

The House has been capped at 435 since 1929. And House seats determine the number of Electoral College votes. If the disparity between the population of the most and least populous states continues to grow, the disproportionality of the House will expand unless the seats are increased. Without change, the cap will continue to corrupt how our presidents are elected. See: r/UncapTheHouse

At this point, the entire Constitution needs a complete rewrite top to bottom.

They also have a heavily armed population but don't suffer the same issues we have. There are arguably a lot of factors at play here. I'm not immediately finding the original study this article no doubt draws from. But here is a brief synopsis. 

.¬†Currently, Swiss legislation¬†bans the use of automatic weapons, silencers, laser sights, and heavy machine guns.

The paperwork for a full auto firearm is faster than in the US, takes about 2 weeks, though it's not legal in every Canton (state), similar to how it's not legal in every state in the US (though it takes much longer in the US and you're limited to firearms registered before 1986).  


Silencers are not particularly hard to get. Slightly harder than in many other country in Europe though. Even in the UK a suppressor is fairly easy to get. In the US the process for a suppresor is the same as buying a machine gun.  


Laser sights might actually be regulated, I'm not entirely sure.

  
Heavy machine guns are not regulated in the Swiss gun law at all.

&#x200B;

>The government demands licensing for the acquisition and carrying of any firearm

Carry (as in for self-defense) yes (and it's only available for professional use, really), for acquisition no.  


For manual action long guns you need an ID and a criminal records extract, no further paperwork than that.  


For a semi-automatic long gun or for handguns, you need a shall issue acquisition permit, which is really the Swiss equivalent to your 4473/NICS that you do when you purchase a firearm in a store.  


The difference is that the acquisition permit is posted to you and you bring it with you, instead of doing it directly in the store. It takes about 1 week to get, and is valid for 3 guns at the same time and location (just get more permits if you want more guns). I.e. it's faster to buy an AR-15 and 2 handguns, than it is in states like California (because they have a 10 day waiting period and max 1 semi-auto rifle/handgun per month).  


>and requires registration and licenses for ownership of firearms

Firearms sold after 2008 are registered with the local Canton police. If you buy firearms in Geneva and move to Bern, the latter will have no idea that you have guns.  


Ownership isn't regulated, purchasing is. And as I mentioned earlier, that does not require a license.

&#x200B;

>with some exceptions made for hunting weapons. 

Not sure what that exception would be. The process is the same for the type of firearms I've mentioned, no matter if you sell privately or buy from a store, or if you're a hunter or not.  


>Practically everyone in Switzerland is trained to use a gun, yes, but that training, as well as the use,

There are zero training requirements to own a firearm. And if you think everyone has done military service, that's also wrong. Conscription is mandatory for males who are Swiss citizens, which is only 38% of the total population, and since 1996 you can choose between civil service and military service (and the latter also has unarmed options). About 17% of the total population of any given birthyear has done military service.

&#x200B;

>storage

By court ruling, your locked front door is considered safe storage. It's not illegal to store your firearm loaded either. You can literally hang a loaded AR15 on your wall and it would be legal.  


> transportation of guns

This is regulated yes, can't have cartridges loaded, not even filled in a magazine that's not attached in the firearm.   


It's however not particularly strict of how and where you transport it. The military instruction video tells you that it's okay to store your service rifle in the trunk of your car when you go and grab a beer with your buddies.

13755,"**From reporters Cate Cadell, John Hudson and Yasmeen Abutaleb:**  
President Biden postponed his top diplomat‚Äôs first official trip to China on Friday in response to the Pentagon‚Äôs discovery of an alleged Chinese spy balloon flying over the continental United States, said a U.S. official familiar with the matter.  
  
The decision came just hours before Secretary of State Antony Blinken was scheduled to depart for Beijing in a dramatic indication of how seriously the Biden administration takes the incident and wants to avoid appearing soft on China.  
  
The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  
  
Since the outset of his presidency, Biden has been sensitive to Republican criticisms that he is insufficiently tough on China, though on the issue of canceling the trip, Republicans were divided on the matter. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas called on the administration to cancel the trip while House Speaker Kevin McCarthy demanded a Gang of Eight intelligence briefing from the president on the balloon.  
  
Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee encouraged Blinken to use the trip to send a tough message to China regarding the suspected spy balloon. But U.S. officials appeared to be concerned about the optics of the visit in wake of the incursion, even though experts said the incident, even if an act of espionage, was not remarkable.  
  
‚ÄúAll countries, especially competitors like the United States and China, spy on each other. It‚Äôs a fact of international relations, and has been forever,‚Äù said Jacob Stokes, an expert at the Center for a New American Security and a former Obama administration official. ‚ÄúAnd we know PRC intelligence extensively targets America.

13757,I hope these balloons are not the chinese version of Alice in borderland‚Äôs blimps,-1,-1
13758,So Americans are butt hurt because they think a Chinese balloon is doing to them what US sattelites are doing all over the world.,-1,-1
13759,One thing I don't understand is why the US waited until it got into Montana to take action publicly. The balloon did fly over Alaska as well and likely a very long stretch of Canada. You physically can't enter Montana without first getting into Canada or elsewhere in the US.,-1,-1

13761,">My best guess is they wanted to judge our response.

13764,"In 1995 Norway forgot to tell russia about a planned missile launch, rather than launching their nukes they called Norway and were like ‚Äúhey did you guys forget to tell us something or share we ending the world‚Äù. Norway had an oh shit moment and then everything was fine. 

Point is governments are wise not to jump to the worst possible conclusions and that included marking sure their citizens aren‚Äôt wildly firing guns into the air. They released the info when they realized China wasn‚Äôt going to do anything about it and it was in a location where everyone wouldn‚Äôt lose their minds.",-1,-1
13765,"**From reporter Aaron Blake about why the shooting-down strategy may not be so simple:**

The Pentagon‚Äôs [stated reason](https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3287204/senior-defense-official-holds-a-background-briefing-on-high-altitude-surveillan/) for not shooting down the balloon yet is the danger it could pose to civilians on the ground. And it says it doubts the information being gleaned from the balloon would be more significant than what China is already obtaining via other means, such as satellites.  
  
‚ÄúWe had been looking at whether there was an option yesterday over some sparsely populated areas in Montana,‚Äù a senior defense official said. ‚ÄúBut we just couldn‚Äôt buy down the risk enough to feel comfortable recommending shooting it down yesterday.‚Äù  
  
The official added that ‚Äúour best assessment at the moment is that whatever the surveillance payload is on this balloon, it does not create significant value added over and above what \[China\] is likely able to collect through things like satellites in low Earth orbit.‚Äù

Officials must be also considering what kind of precedent would be set by shooting it down, both for the United States and its adversaries. There could also be value observing the balloon ‚Äî and a downside to showing China and others how we would dispatch such a threat.  
  
All of which was noted Friday by a rare Republican skeptic of the just-shoot-it-down strategy. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) suggested that the balloon could be an attempt by China to ‚Äúbait the United States into disputes over appropriate rights in the air.‚Äù

Aaron dives more into the history of aerial surveillance in the U.S. here: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/02/03/chinese-balloon-aerial-surveillance-history/?utm\_campaign=wp\_main&utm\_medium=social&utm\_source=reddit.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/02/03/chinese-balloon-aerial-surveillance-history/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit.com)

13766,"Advantages:

13767,"doesn't even matter what the medium is; having a foreign state come in and start surreptitiously surveying whatever they can is not the kind of thing the government is likely to just accept.   
  
the US has enjoyed a long period of domestic peace (9/11 terror attack notwithstanding) but the government isn't complacent. they still have to slap wrists for overreach.",-1,-1
13768,They also wouldn't just shoot something down that is clearly just a show. Why escalate matters?,-1,-1
13769,How do you know it is not a CIA balloon? How did it get there? Did it fly all the way from China? What is it collecting that sattelites can't? The whole scenario is ridiculous and stinks of distraction,-1,-1
13770,"That's the other strange piece -- the US could have contacted China when it first got into Alaska. They would have worked something out in the meantime. Of course we don't yet know if that did happen, but it doesn't look like it did, because nobody has mentioned that. I don't understand this either: why wouldn't the US just as a gesture of caution contact China and say ""hey we noticed a balloon over Alaska, want to figure out a solution before it potentially figuratively blows up in case it reaches somewhere much less peripheral?""",-1,-1
13771,"It's saying why the US didn't shoot it down once it's in Montana. But my question is why the US only took public action until it reached Montana, when it did go through Alaska earlier.

13776,"your repeated misspelling of satellites is ridiculous and stinks of distraction. 

But yeah, the whole thing is a bit odd. China has said it was ""mainly meteorological purposes"" which just makes me question the ""mainly"" part of that explanation. And they said it veered off course due to unexpected winds. Supposedly it was tracked going over the Aleutian Islands, through Canada, and now spotted over Montana. But weather balloons tend to only travel like 100 miles.",-1,-1
13777,Because China literally said it was their balloon,-1,-1

13779,High level government contacts aren‚Äôt revealed to the public and you find that weird?,-1,-1
13780,Ringing up the Chinese right when we detected the balloon is a great way to let the Chinese know our sensing abilities. Waiting until it was halfway across the continent before going public with the detection is far less helpful to the PLA.,-1,-1
13781,I could see the US waiting to see whether China would say something first.,-1,-1
13782,"Apologies. Thanks for clarifying. Haven't seen this particular question answered in our reporting yet or in the official Pentagon statement, but if I do find this answer, will let you know! - Amy",-1,-1
13783,"Probably bc now that it's in the lower 48 they know that people will spot it, so they want to get out ahead of the story.",-1,-1
13784,"What I find weird is that *both parties* act as though they'd only now learned about this and have made zero reference, explicitly or implicitly, to any prior contacts.

Edit: wording",-1,-1
13785,That theory doesn't explain why the US has mentioned an official sighting over the Aleutian Islands -- pretty much the earliest place you'd expect the US to take notice.,-1,-1
13786,"I see -- but that still feels really risky. 

1) if China knows and doesn't want to say anything, for any reason, including idk say embarrassment -- then the US would certainly escalate the situation much more by making a big reveal in Montana than when it was just in Alaska or crossed into northern Canada. I'm just not quite sure how this would be in the US' interest -- although it would be a solid reason, but ultimately not a major one, to postpone the Blinken visit, if that's what the US wants (which...it would still be pretty weird). It's certainly not at all conducive to a better relationship or easing tensions between the countries.

2) *if* China somehow doesn't know about the balloon, then the wait wouldn't even make sense. To wait, the US must have intelligence that the Chinese state 1) has active knowledge of the balloon, at least of its existence and its path, and also 2) recognises the ballon as an intelligence balloon of the state, which would spark a diplomatic row, instead of anything else for which it might not feel the need to say anything.",-1,-1

13831,"Maybe, but counter-point:  Marjorie Taylor Green has been re-elected and appointed to committees now.  Similar things were said about Marj two years ago.

My belief is what you're saying probably has a shaving's worth of truth, but there's not going to be enough for a noticeable impact.  He won't be re-elected, to be fair, but to say he's affecting the perception of Republicans to Republican voters nation-wide in a way that reflects voting patterns...just saying, I've been hurt before and fear my skepticism has plenty of precedent supporting it.  They were already voting for Hershel Walker elsewhere when they knew he was lying.

The endgame for voters has shifted to national policy, and if it takes embarrassing individuals to get what Republicans want then Republicans will seek them.",-1,-1
13832,Most of the country has already moved on. This whole thing will be completely forgotten by the next election cycle.,-1,-1
13833,"There's only one party in which this level of deceit is allowed:

The GOP. The Party of ""MAGA.""

**Never** trust a Republican again.",-1,-1
13834,"And Kevin McCarthy supports him by saying Santos was elected, not elected under false pretences, but simply elected.

Is there anyone even remotely sane and honest in the GOP?",-1,-1
13835,"By ""fucked up"", he meant getting caught.",-1,-1
13836,He is a highly decorated World War II veteran. Show some respect.,-1,-1
13837,"He's a 2 bit con man who thought he could ride Trumps con man coattails to a modest pension and some Healthcare for life.  And whatever salary he could get out of 6 or so years in Congress.


Dude needed to get elected in 2020 when he first ran and maybe he could have ducked this.  Running in 2022 was a massive mistake for him.",-1,-1
13838,The most accurate thing I've heard about this person is that he is Roger Smith from American Dad.,-1,-1
13839,"I'm sure it was the getting caught part that he was talking about. How he expected to not get caught with such a bizarre trail of lies, I have no idea. I guess he saw what Trump was getting away with and just figured he could lie like that, too.",-1,-1
13840,"Someone might have blackmail on him unrelated to what we‚Äôve already seen, or he‚Äôs very deep in debt and needs help. 

There‚Äôs no way he could have faked all of this himself. He isn‚Äôt smart enough. Someone coached him. Someone who he works for.",-1,-1

13842,"You give him too much credit. 

This guy just didn‚Äôt figure out how to get away with massive fraud.

13846,"Yeah, he fucked up as in he got caught. No remorse, only regret that some of his actions (in this case: all) caught enough attention to backfire on him.",-1,-1
13847,Getting caught really hasn‚Äôt changed much for him. I guess he‚Äôs not as useful to his ‚Äòowners‚Äô with all the media attention. But Republicans don‚Äôt seem concerned by the fraud at all.,-1,-1
13848,"> He lied to his constituents and doesn't have the slightest bit of regret other than he got caught.

His getting caught *is* the f\*up. But his base will say that the dishonesty was the f\*up and he‚Äôs really a good guy. Unless the party turns on him, then the herd will follow and turn their backs on him‚Ä¶",-1,-1
13849,"I think the ""fuck up"" part was that he didn't intend to win.  He was just trying to be part of a election money laundering/grifting scheme, and assuming he would lose and never get the kind of attention that would bring in all of these investigations.",-1,-1
13850,"I think that's giving him too much credit.  He clearly has a psychological disorder that compels him to lie about any and everything.  He didn't do this methodically, because the lies contradict one another and are easily disputed.   He has a serious psychological sickness and should be nowhere near Congress.  He should seek help.

That being said, his finances align with his lies but could indicate something more nefarious.  That will be easy for investigators to find out, though.",-1,-1
13851,Fuckedn't,-1,-1

Because most normal folks don't like dishonesty you lump of clay in a cheap suit",-1,-1
13856,I think he also said he‚Äôs done lying from now on. We can fully believe there will be no more ‚Äúbad doings‚Äù from him.,-1,-1
13857,"That's really funny, since it's exactly what a narcissist would think when they get called out. ""I thought I was faking empathy perfectly! Why are these other people so unfair to me?"".",-1,-1
13858,"Until they find out he isn't due to his drag performances. The ammunition against him doesn't just disgust Democrats, it also disgusts Republicans and leftists equally. All sides of the spectrum have plenty of reasons to hate him.",-1,-1
13859,That is objectively not true.  There are literally daily national stories in national media on this topic. Your appeal to futility is based on fantasy.,-1,-1
13860,"Meanwhile, his constituents are about to board a bus and take the protests to his office.",-1,-1
13861,"Not allowed.

Encouraged.

Conservatives *demand* followers of their ideology be as dishonest as possible. Having to tell the truth is a sign of weakness to them.",-1,-1
13862,I've stopped trusting Republicans (ever again) since watching Susan Collins do not a thing about Trump.,-1,-1
13863,"At this point, ‚ÄúRepublican‚Äù and ‚ÄúChristian conservative‚Äù is synonymous in my mind with Nazi. Like, maybe even worse honestly. Anytime someone tells me they vote republican, or even ‚Äúlean left but fiscally conservative‚Äù, all I see is a cross burning and trains filled with ‚Äúundesirables‚Äù headed to a camp somewhere.",-1,-1

The mistake was trusting them before. This isn't new.",-1,-1
13865,Manchin.,-1,-1
13866,"The media is largely to blame as well.  These republicans all go on Chuck Todd and every weekend show, and are questioned daily and not one pundit or ""journalist"" has pushed back on McCarthy when he claims Santos was duly elected.  His voters DIDN'T KNOW WHO THEY WERE VOTING FOR!  All his personas are fraudulent.  Not one ""reporter"" has pointed that out.",-1,-1
13867,Either roger or Fred Savage‚Äôs replacement for Limbaugh,-1,-1
13868,"That's always been my read.  He's so out of his depths for conning here.  Had he ran during Trumps tenure or even in 16(he couldn't win then though) he could have escaped the focus.


He got in because of redistricting and the DCCC was a fucking mess in NY.",-1,-1
13869,"I get why people continually give the GOP too much credit, though. It‚Äôs mentally exhausting to even process the extent to which they go out of their way to be pieces of shit. Normal people don‚Äôt think like that. It‚Äôs a party of sociopaths.",-1,-1
13870,"George is always singing ""It's All Over But The Lying"". His record is stuck at that, needle always jumps back to beginning.",-1,-1
13871,Republicans love to use people that aren't straight white men as tools to oppress other groups.  They see him being a drag queen as an opportunity to attack one of their most hated groups.,-1,-1
13872,"People will never be sick of George Santos. House members are only 2 years, so before you know it someone will announce a challenge, and that person will talk all kinds of trash. 

Then there will be stories about whether he can reelected, and the criminal investigation. You right, he‚Äôs not fading anywhere",-1,-1
13873,Fantasy based on what? You think I fantasize about the voter base having the memory of a fruit fly?,-1,-1
13874,"The only thing demanded of their ideology is to gain as much power and hold as much power as possible for as long as possible. If that means telling a lie gets them power, they will tell a lie. If telling the truth will increase their power, they will tell the truth. If encouraging their supporters to go to the Capitol with the intent to have those supporters violently overthrow the government has the potential to give them power, then by god they'll do that too.",-1,-1
13875,Grudging upvote.,-1,-1
13876,"Exactly! McCarthy is engaging in sophistry and nothing more.

Trump set an extremely low (arguably nonexistent) standard for Political Truth and Santos is just riding the flow without any qualms.",-1,-1
13877,"You are off base. GOP is using ChatGPT type AI to influence their base. And to pin point weak points in the US political system. 

Idiots dont figure out that Secretaries of state are a weak point and then attack them, and install their own corrupt versions. 

This is pretty high level strategy that can only be executed with broad support and a network of confederates. 

Santos is not a con, he's manufactured by people who know how to start shell companies, move money and make fake donations.",-1,-1
13878,"It will impact his own election for sure, but I don't think anyone else's failure to condemn him will impact them at all, unfortunately.",-1,-1
13879,"I work with a couple conspiracy theorist conservatives and they are extremely deranged and live in an entire other reality.

One of them works directly with me and the other is more-or-less a delivery person for the company we work for.

I know for a fact the dude I work closely with frequents 2A extremist sites, is an avowed Infowars devotee, etc but it's just so insane to me how utterly detached and conditioned to believe nonsense these right-wingers are.",-1,-1
13880,"Republicans today are culture war content creators for Fox and right wing media, billionaires that run social media platforms like Musk, Zuckerberg, etc. 
They get away with it because they have a propaganda machine spewing manufactured outrage 24/7/365.

13882,I think they define themselves by the 'struggle' against an enemy. Much like Christian warriors against thr devil. They need an something or someone to fight and the conspiracy theories stoke the anger they all have and don't know where to direct.,-1,-1

13890,"Former President Donald Trump‚Äôs copyright claim in a lawsuit against author Bob Woodward faces several major obstacles while touching on unsettled questions about intellectual property rights over recorded interviews.  
  
Trump‚Äôs litigation against Woodward, his publisher Simon & Schuster Inc., and its parent Paramount Global targeted the release of audio recordings of 2019 and 2020 interviews without permission.  
  
He‚Äôs demanding $50 million and seeking a court order declaring that his responses are creative expressions that grant him sole authorship over the recordings, a copyright that would extend to derivative works such as Woodward‚Äôs audiobook, ‚ÄúThe Trump Tapes: Bob Woodward‚Äôs Twenty Interviews with President Donald Trump.‚Äù  
  
That copyright claim could sink on several grounds, according to copyright lawyers who largely regard the claim‚Äîon the whole‚Äîas frivolous. Intuition suggests to many that an interviewee has no expectation of being able to prevent an interviewer from using their responses.",-1,-1
13891,"Filing frivolous lawsuits to cause his detractors to incur legal fees and to attract attention is, of course, a Trump tradition.

When he sued biographer Timothy O'Brien in 2006, he repeatedly claimed that his intent was to bankrupt him.   His publisher, Warner Books, paid all of his legal fees.

Get ready for Trump to sue C-Span for broadcasting his State of the Union Addresses.",-1,-1
13892,"I would be super surprised if courts ruled that merely speaking is enough to grant copyright. Everyone will sue everyone else, people will be afraid to speak in general because they have nothing wholly original to say. Except maybe ""let me laminate my testicles and then have them bronzed."" Pretty sure that was original.",-1,-1
13893,"""Intriguing"" is not a word I'd like to hear from an IP lawyer in reference to my argument's merit, myself. That's usually code for ""somewhere between naive and ignorant"" in my experience.",-1,-1

14024,"When I was a kid we had a half rottie/half lab mix that was like that. He was fuckin biiig, so if he walked by you while wagging his tail (which was pretty much always) it was like taking a baseball bat to the knee. More than once he cleared off the coffee table with that thing.",-1,-1
14025,Had a Great Dane growing up that would wag his tail so hard he‚Äôd sometimes break it open on hard surfaces and sling blood everywhere. The vet even talked about partial amputation because it was impossible to keep a bandage on it because he‚Äôd just wag the bandage off and reopen his injury.,-1,-1
14026,"Some dogs need their tail docked because of that. They can end up breaking it repeatedly, some dogs just have whip tails.",-1,-1
14027,"Lol, my sister-in-law's dog is 90lbs and her tail feels like a baseball bat. She's so clumsy and adorable too! We literally have to hold her at bay when she's greeting everyone so she doesn't accidentally knock a kid over in her excitement. (Usually I just pull her into a corner with me to wrestle/hug it out until she's gotten out the wiggles. It's my favorite part of family gatherings)",-1,-1

14039,"Perhaps equally adorable and fluffier, but not as goofy and fun as a Boxer.",-1,-1
14040,They actually injure themselves quite often from wagging their tail too vigorously. They're such lovably stupid dogs.,-1,-1

14047,We semi lovingly nicknamed our great Dane/rottweiler mix nut cracker. He was just the perfect height to neuter people with his tail wagging,-1,-1

14052,"this is legit not one of those reddit crybaby things, it‚Äôs fucking true. Dogs can and will break their tails. It‚Äôs the reason why certain breeds have their tails clipped early so that they don‚Äôt have to deal with injury in the future.

14060,"Good. That's much safer. But cats are surprisingly solid for their weight, if that's the right way to put it. It's like they put all their 10 pounds on one foot when it's on you. I have a smaller dog (for me), 35 pounds. But she weighs a ton when she's on my stomach üò±",-1,-1

I found that beautiful standard issue cat, senior model and fell in love. Around 9am I mailed the shelter, around noon they called if I'd like to visit her. On the way to the shelter I bought everything from a carrier to food and toys. She instantly tolerated my existence and I was allowed to take her home with me. She didn't hide under the bed but started to check out her new home, chirping for me from time to time to reassure I'm still there. After that she hopped on my sofa and curled up next to me and took a nap. I was so overwhelmed because it all happened so fast. From the first night on she'd sleep in my bed completely at home. 

I think in both of our cases it was meant to happen.",-1,-1

14678,Awe i love her! She looks like my spike. He belonged to my awful neighbors that never provided warmth or safety to him. He would visit me every day so I set him up a heated shelter on my porch. One day he decided he wasn't going back home. After they had him neutered at my constant urging he was attacked badly by a neighbor cat leaving scars and ripping out his nails. They left him out in the freezing weather to recover from both. I brought him in at night and he was fine with them. He's been with me now for years. The owner's mother told me after she was so glad I kept him because her son took terrible care of him. He's my whole heart. As a dog person I never thought I could live a cat like this.,-1,-1

Honestly, I loved reading your responses to questions in this post as you genuinely seem to love & appreciate her. So many people get cats without realizing how much care and attention they need to live a happy, fulfilled life. People who say ""cats are independent"" don't understand that a happy cat will be VERY social, very interactive,  or at least want to be near their humans as much as possible.  When my cats are left alone in the morning,  or *think* they are alone,  they howl for a few minutes, while walking around,  looking for us!! Lol.

Anyway sorry to go off on such a tangent, it is just really nice to see someone who obviously loves and appreciates this sweet baby. Thank you for saving her from shelter life and giving her a forever home‚ù§",-1,-1

Those long slow blinks are her equivalent of kisses - saying she trusts you so much she can close her eyes and not have to be on alert for predators because she knows she is safe with you. It is the highest compliment in cat communication. I imagine she hasn't felt safe in a long time so the fact it has happened so quickly says you're going to have a very special bond indeed.",-1,-1

Our current ecosystems have evolved concurrently over millennia and anything we destroy won‚Äôt recover in our lifetimes, maybe not in our species‚Äô lifetime.

Four days ago we saw a vet who suspects she developed an inflammatory condition similar to MS in humans. We started her on steroids and she has been improving since!

Couldn't think of anything. 

Right now, our vet is cautiously suspecting granulomatous meningoencephalitis which really has no specific cause, but without a brain biopsy we can't confirm that or any other neurological inflammatory/auto-immune condition. I'm just happy the steroids seem to be working :)",-1,-1

15110,That‚Äôs exactly what I/we are suspecting. Current thought is granulomatous meningioencephalitis (ie non-infectious). Do you recall what specific type they were diagnosed with? There are quite a few subtypes but unfortunately the vets I‚Äôve seen aren‚Äôt too familiar with them.,-1,-1

The pathophysiology of both MS and GME are variable and not super well studied (more-so GME).  While MS is widely accepted to have contribution from auto-reactive T-cells causing partial demyelination, GME has been found to have high levels of lymphocytes and macrophages causing granulomas, inflammation, and perivascular infiltration (but no necessarily demyelination). 

Although I compared the two, it was more so based on the presentation (sudden and diffuse motor symptoms) rather than the pathogenesis :)",-1,-1

However, you'd be correct to say we have no definitively ruled out a primary brain tumor, that is very much still on the table (just lower down on the list). 

If I had all the money in the world, I would get her an MRI asap to rule this in/out. Unfortunately, my husband and I are not made of money, I am in medical school so that already makes things tight.

15123,"I believe it was granulomatous meningoencephalitis. The onset of symptoms were tremors (she would be very visibly shaking), difficulty walking (started with not being able to jump up on the couch or bed at first, but then walking altogether), she was eventually unable to hold her head up to eat (possibly a stiff neck).

They ended up seeing a specialist who put her on, I believe, an immunosuppressant and steroids. Initially they thought it might resolve with medication, but each time they ramped down the medication the symptoms would come back. Eventually they ended up finding the appropriate maintenance dose. Their girl is pretty much back to her normal self with the little bit of medication each day.

It sounds like it may possibly be what is going on, but I‚Äôm certainly not a vet. If your vet is not as experienced with diagnosing and treating these types of conditions, perhaps there is a specialist they might be able to recommend?

It's pretty common in desert areas (I lived in Tucson, and it was a risk for pets and people there). It's not something you would even see. They're spores that would get kicked up out of the dirt and settle into the lungs. They can cause all sorts of problems if they spread. 

I would be surprised if it was with where you live, but there's been a lot recently about how warming temperatures are causing the fungus to spread, so it wouldn't be crazy to have them consider it. I hope your pup recovers soon.",-1,-1

I had to take a moment to digest this, and asked as politely as possible ‚Äú-in dog years?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo, this was my childhood dog. He‚Äôs 46 years old.‚Äù

Again, I had to pause to assess if she was crazy, but she was absolutely dead serious, and a bit indignant that I questioned her.

I just jotted it down for the appointment and sent her on her way. My coworker nearby had overheard, and we reasoned that her dad had probably replaced the family dogs a few times over the years, and this poor naive lady was majorly in denial.

A lot of super elderly people don't have much regular contact with others, it's easy for an also-elderly child of theirs to avoid filing the paperwork when they pass and continue to collect their pension/etc and pretend to be them.

There's also some funny business that goes on in poorer countries (at least I was told about it happening when my parents were born 40-50 years ago, though it probably still happens today).  In smaller villages they don't have proper documentation when children are born, and sometimes don't get any until a few years later when they travel to the bigger city where those services are available.  I have been told by someone that their family used to age-up their kids when they got documentation, so they would be able to vote/retire/etc sooner (and presumably reap other benefits).  And the documentation they eventually get can later be used for immigration purposes/passports, etc.

The average human life expectancy is 69.8. Again, it is general data, but same as above, this allows us to compare.  A similar human being would have to be 160 years old.

His right foot is white so the puppy photo looks spot on other than being mirrored.  

His chin is still white, it is not unusual for a dogs coat colors to change as they age.

Lots of dog breeds are born white and darken with age.  Just like humans, born blonde hair blue eyed and darken over time.  For example, Dalmatians are born without spots, Pomeranians are born with white fluff that turns to brown or red as they mature.  Heelers, which have pretty crazy coat colors and patterns as adults start out snow white and that‚Äôs just what I can think of off hand.

He is likely microchipped and while someone could technically cut a chip out of a dead dog and inject it into a new one that looks super similar but the likely hood of that is pretty low.  Not to mention he has quite a unique face‚Ä¶.",-1,-1

So, hoping you're not one of them and beforehand telling i have no qualms with the prospect that this all might be faked, here's i think it's most likely that there wasn't a switch.

First, people are pointing to a 1999 picture, and most specifically to the front paws, to allude that it isn't the same dog. Ok, now consider how fat he is now and take that into account. It's only normal that he looks different. As for the white fur in his paws, in the videos of him walking around, you see the white fur still there, but it has been shifted downwards. It's still quite noticeable on his right paw, while on the left paw it retreated a fair bit more. Now if you ever had puppies, you see them grow up and you notice instantly that they look quite different when they grow up. The same goes for gaining a ton of weight as he aged.

As for the other remark people make about switching the dog's registration, unless they'd show up with a newborn puppy in 2008 at the vet and said it was the same dog and the vet was like ""sure... i buy that"" for whatever reason i cannot understand, the only other to fake it was to show up with a dog that looked 15 but was in fact just 1 year old.

It shouldn't matter the style or color of the clothing.. I find people will be outraged by a dog in colors but won't think twice about a dog in black.

And of course if it stresses your dog out it should be a hard no, but if it goes on easily amd they go about their day with no whites of their eyes showing or trying to get it off it is completely fine. Besides no one will think twice about who's service dog he is, haha.",-1,-1

16326,"I don't think people are ""outraged about a dog in colors"" -- people just don't like seeing you dressing up a pet like they're some accessory or doll. A dog isn't there for decoration. 

Whites of their eyes isn't the only sign of anxiety. If your dog excessively pants, fidgets, scratches, or is generally more restless when you dress him up, then he doesn't want to wear a shirt. Just because he doesn't struggle when you dress him, that doesn't mean he's enjoying it. Anxieties may build up gradually over an extended period of time.",-1,-1

16345,"He wears it out when it's cold and that's it.

There's no difference between a standard step in dog coat and a dog hoodie if you're not using the hood, especially in a very cold climate.. infact I'd rather it without the hood, it is for a functional reason and I couldn't help realizing they do matching ones for people. And it's as simple and quick to put on as a suiticle or step in dog coat, which is all it is.. it's equipped with harness holes the back too.",-1,-1
16346,"Hahah that's the best, my boy hates being wrapped in a towel for example because it'll just come off but if you put his hoodie on or one of my shirts he's happy as hell.


I hate that people judge so much over it. Because like I genuinely wouldn't do it if he didn't like it, most dogs might not like it but my boy? He likes being toasty and as a dog owner you know your dog best and certainly wouldn't buy sweaters that cost money to not be used or that our dogs hate.


 he has one hoodie he wears all winter long, keeps his organs warm.. I might get another so I can wash and rotate them.. its not about style it's comfort too.

The hood for example isn't necessary but finding good quality matching stuff for humans and dogs is hard.. but he doesn't even notice a little fabric draping on the back of his neck tucked under his work harness.

And I needed something I'd wear myself.

The only time he wears is hoodie is for trips out when it's cold because he's a fit healthy young lab so there's no need, he wore a suit after being neutered.",-1,-1

This boy is a relatively new addition, he's only 8 months old so I'm not super confident in his recall yet because some familial crises occurred that slowed the progress of his training, but we are getting back on track. This provides a space where he can run, we can practice recall, and don't have to worry about potential issues involved with others :)

With fur as white as snow, and eyes that stand out from the rest.  
It wanders in the night, with grace and silent pace,  
But sometimes feels alone, in this world with a different face.

It hears the whispers, of the other raccoons with fur so dark,  
And wonders why it's different, and if it's meant to leave its mark.  
But it stands tall, and with its head held high,  
For it knows, deep inside, that it's meant to fly.

It lives a life, that's not like the others,  
But it finds a way to thrive, with its own unique colours.  
It finds its own path, in a world that's full of surprise,  
And shines so bright, like a star in the sky.

So let us cherish this creature of the night,  
And all its differences, that make it unique in sight.  
For it is a reminder, that it's okay to be different too,  
And that in this world, there's a place for me and for you.",-1,-1

17676,"Dogs, what's the big deal? Everywhere I turn, I see people fawning over these four-legged pests. People treat them like they are royalty, constantly praising their loyalty, intelligence, and cuteness. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's all a big scam. 

Dogs are nothing but trouble. They bark at everything and anything, causing a commotion wherever they go. They jump on people, slobber all over everything, and never seem to tire of annoying everyone around them. And don't even get me started on their constant need for attention. It's like they can never get enough.

What's so special about dogs, anyway? They are not nearly as intelligent as cats, who are independent creatures that can take care of themselves. Dogs, on the other hand, are constantly seeking attention and approval from their owners. It's almost like they have no self-esteem.

And let's not forget about the messes they make. Dogs shed all over the place, leaving hair everywhere. They also like to dig holes in the yard, making it look like a war zone. And let's not forget about their ""accidents."" It's like they have no regard for personal property.

In conclusion, dogs are overrated. They are loud, messy, and always in need of attention. They are not nearly as intelligent or independent as cats, who are the true rulers of the pet world. So, let's give dogs a break and start giving some well-deserved attention to the true royalty of the pet world: cats.

Edit- no my parentheses wasn't sarcastic actually.

I know for a fact my cat does not only love me for food lmao, I wasn't his sole provider when he was adopted and he knew that. And he still chose to cuddle up on my sweaty armpits. Maybe it's because biologically he liked my scent, maybe it's because I kind of act like a Big Hairless Cat, maybe he could sense that I would give my entire life up for him without blinking. I don't care. You could do the same amount of thinking for Human Love and still end up at- I don't care why, it's just nice that they love me. *That* was the point of me comparing 'emotions' to 'biological drive'. They're basically the same imo, seeing as people who have PhDs in this crap still can't agree on where our cuddly lovey hormones come from lmfao",-1,-1

18092,"I split mine up into 3 categories: Entertaining, Educational, and Promotional; the amount of days you do each depends on your audience. From there, I look at any highly relevant holidays and anything the business is announcing, rolling out, or events. 

Other than that, I generally create content only 1-2 weeks in advance because the digital world is constantly changing and what is trending today won't be trending in a month.

18093,"As a social media manager, planning a monthly social media calendar is an important aspect of ensuring a consistent and effective online presence for a small business.

To start, I identify the business goals and objectives I want to achieve through social media, understand my target audience and their preferences, and look at the engagement and reach of previous posts to determine what content performs best and what topics resonate with my audience. 

Based on these insights, I plan content themes for each month that include special events, promotions, holidays, etc. I then use a scheduling tool or calendar to plan and schedule my posts in advance, making sure to mix in different types of content such as text posts, photos, and videos. 

Finally, I regularly review and analyze the performance of my posts to identify any patterns and make adjustments to the calendar as needed.

18101,You may want to consider opening a new account and follow only those accounts that help you stay up to date with what's happening without any personal connections.,-1,-1
18102,You need to find things to do outside of work that will help you reset the day. Do you have any hobbies?,-1,-1
18103,"I might be able to offer some advice/perspective here. I've worked in social media... pretty much since there were social media jobs (so...what... 2007/8-ish?). I'm in my 40s, and have worked for lots of businesses in lots of sectors over the years (for the record, I'm higher up the career ladder now than then, but yep, still have to spend time on various social platforms, keep up to date with trends and functionality and so on).   


A couple of people have mentioned starting new accounts. This is definitely key. You can cross the streams a bit depending on which type of business you work for (the targeted ads I get are completely mental now because of industry changes over the years, IG doesn't know what to make of me), but keep a pro and a 'home' profile. I have several accounts on different platforms, mainly so I can try out new things without looking like a weirdo on my usual account).   


If you don't want to interact with social content outside of work, then don't. Get info by reading trends reports and blog posts, the advertising press etc. or going to conferences.   


While always being on social can occasionally help you spot trends or memes early, as you progress in your career, it's far more useful to be able to think about those trends strategically. Look for movements in the way people communicate, and where, rather than what they actually say day-to-day. If trends are key, then get Google alerts or a social listening tool set up and have it send you emails about unusual phrase volume rather than hunting it out yourself.   


When I started out, I would spend HOURS each day on social (mainly Twitter back then), wake up in the middle of the night and check my phone and so on. Even then, you will ALWAYS have blind spots - there's just too much happening in the world to see it all. It's not like I know what's happening on VALO or VKontakt right now, and I don't need to, if you were set up on a platform like that for work you'd need local people to help run it/create messaging/respond. 

&#x200B;

You can be better at your job by monitoring work-related streams during work hours, seeing how your customers and prospects speak, and using that as a basis for your activity.   


There's a good quote from Stephen Covey  I like to remember at work: ""The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing"". You aren't paid to be on TikTok 24/7. You're paid to be a content expert with technical expertise in certain platforms. That will actually help with business - a lot of companies fall into the trap of thinking they have to be relentlessly posting stuff, but honestly, most of them really, really don't. Social media can be a black hole, so it's fine to make sure you don't fall in.",-1,-1
18104,Stop being trend follower. Read magazines relative to advertising and tech. Focus on music lyrics for word play and caption inspo. Read books for languages and grammar structure. Don‚Äôt be afraid to think outside the box. Take risks with your content ideas. Not all will be home runs but you will be happier in the curation process. Might even have a light bulb moment or two.,-1,-1
18105,"It‚Äôs probably easier said than done and I still struggle with this as well.

I would say give yourself blocks of times where you can freely consume any form of social media. If you have free time during work, that can be one of your moments.

I know you‚Äôll get the feeling of falling behind, missing out on a trend, missing some crucial pop culture reference but at the end of the day you also have to evaluate how well these things will actually transfer over to your work. Also, if a trend sticks around you‚Äôll have plenty of time to see it and work it into your job somehow. Don‚Äôt stress out too much over it affecting your job.

That aside, I can say from my own experience Twitter has caused me the most stress. If I don‚Äôt need to go on it outside of work, I stay as far away as possible. The comment sections of any platform comes in 2nd, so I usually avoid those as well (when I‚Äôm not working). When consuming social media during your free time (outside of work related tasks), I would try and look for content that aligns with your hobbies/interests. Probably also turn those notifications off. 

Again, easier said than done but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll figure out the perfect way to balance everything :). I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôve all suffered through this at some point‚Ä¶ or still currently haha.",-1,-1

18111,Outsource the brainstorming. Im in the same position. It sucks big time because my mindset is anti overconsumption.,-1,-1
18112,"I've struggled with this as well (as I mindlessly scroll through Reddit). Two things have helped me.

1. Block dedicated time in you day (I've tried 30 minutes, but pick an amount of time that suits your needs) to  spend time on the various apps. When the time is up put the phone down.

2. Use app timers to ensure you're spending a reasonable amount of time on FB, IG, TikTok, etc.",-1,-1

18115,"I also work a social media marketing job and I feel this. The most helpful things for me was making a separate account that I only use for work, and then I downloaded a social media app blocker that I used during off-work hours to avoid mindless scrolling.",-1,-1
18116,"You should consider the possibility that you need to find a job that isn't focused on social media.  ""If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out.""  Jobs are important, but one that is putting you in a downward spiral is taking away something more important than what it gives back.    


Otherwise, you should analyze what exactly makes you unhappy when you're on social media.    A lot of people feel inadequate next to their peers' apparently perfect lives.  That's a feeling that you could address.  Ask yourself, Is there something in your history that makes you extra vulnerable to that?  If so, it needs to be dealt with even if you left social forever.  And you can address the issue almost everyone has with social which is that we know intellectually that what we see is not representative of our friends' lives (generally speaking) but on an emotional level we accept the facebook stream as a truth we then measure ourselves against.   Try training yourself into awareness of this on a level that will allow you to stop that from happening,    


Third option: stop doing a the job your bosses want you to do and focus instead on making your bosses believe you are doing what they want you to do.  The pressure is on you because they are too old to see what the trends are?  Then they lack the information to know the difference between a real trend you suss out from reviewing a million posts, versus one you make up while taking a bubble bath.  Most of what is written about trends is total bullshit, most trends are idiotic: what's the real difference in value for the client between that, and you picking a post you like and declaring it trend?  Unless they're using scientifically-collected data and rigorous statistical analysis (which no-one does), no one can prove that any of these declared trends actually exist.  The majority of them probably do not, or their reality (if it were known) is significantly different from how they are characterized.  Why not develop a system where you work on developing good marketing ideas largely ignoring social media, and then use limited time on the platforms to cherry-pick examples to show that what you propose to do is a ""trend"". I guarantee you, you would not be the first person to take this approach.  You could drastically cut your social media time and your bosses won't know the difference.",-1,-1
18117,"I second this! 7 years in the industry now, and my personal account is a graveyard. 

Just keep a ""test account"" to follow brands that are great at social and other interesting accounts. You can even use it to test our your posts to make sure they show up properly/aren't cropped etc before scheduling on the main brand account. 

The head of social/digital that I work with does the same thing. It's a running joke in the agency that the two of us (team leads for social) are ironically the two people who have zero personal social media presence.

I monitor trends via newsletters (Matt Navarra, Axios Marketing, Nicole Tabak, Morning Brew's Jack Appleby etc.) it's great because it's aggregating the trends and news for you, and then I have dummy accounts toggle between 1) I have one for peers and competitors morning 2) one for industry insights and 3) one for people or brands whose content I admire and want to leverage at my own organization.

4. For Twitter there are tools like Testimonial (io) and Senja (io) promoted as social proof tools but they are doing the same work as social listening tools. So, you can use them too.

I can recommend the online activity tracker Snoopreport. However, it works exclusively for Instagram and this is its main disadvantage. With it, you can add up to 100 users with a public profile to the tracking and receive weekly reports about their hashtags, likes, follows and interests. Depending on the tasks, I track the activity of my current followers or competitors' followers. I use the obtained data to compile a content strategy, select local hashtags, analyze the audience of bloggers for cooperation, and so on.

18134,"I used metricool because it was all the rage and a bunch of SMM were pushing it pretty hard. As a data person, I was like yeah okay let‚Äôs try it.

Pros. It‚Äôs pretty user friendly (there‚Äôs some clunky bits but it‚Äôs not terrible) and it does support quite a few platforms, it‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ affordable ish.

Cons. Analytics are totally and completely inconsistent, for me this is is a HARD PASS (same thing reason why I hate Sprinklr but I dislike Sprinklr more than Metricool). Customer support (in my experience) was pretty unreliable in how the product works and how their API works with social media platforms. I have also heard absolute horror stories about their ad issues (but I never used that so I don‚Äôt know for sure).

These types of problems usually happen when a platform/company tries to do too much and scale too fast. I know of people who like the platform for the most part, however, no one in the industry with a sizeable amount of clients recommends it.

18190,Do you mean strategy or like a content schedule?,-1,-1
18191,"Here are a few tips that I've found helpful when creating a plan:

  
1. Set Goals: Before you start creating your plan, it's important to set goals for what you want to achieve with your social media presence. This will help you focus your efforts and measure your success.

  
2. Research Your Audience: Knowing who your target audience is will help you create content that resonates with them. Researching their interests, needs, and preferences will help you create content that is tailored to them.

  
3. Choose Platforms: Once you know who your target audience is, you can decide which platforms are best for reaching them. Different platforms have different strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to choose the ones that are best suited for your goals.  For example, if you're looking to share visual content, Instagram and Pinterest are great options. If you're looking to share more text-based content, Twitter and LinkedIn are great options.

  
4. Paid advertisements: it can be a great way to get your message out to a larger audience. However, it is important to consider your budget and the type of audience you are trying to reach before investing in paid advertisements. There are also many agencies on Instagram such as Ascend viral that can help to get the targeted audience. 

  
5. Create Content: Now that you know who your audience is and which platforms you'll be using, you can start creating content. Think about what type of content your audience will find interesting and engaging.",-1,-1
18192,I guess that's where my confusion is. I want to focus on strategy. I've been making content blindly.,-1,-1
18193,"Well you need both. 
Strategy in short: 
You have business goals that you transcribe into social media goals. (E.g.: increase brand awareness = reach) 
You look at your target audience which determines the platforms you should post on. 
You look at those platforms and find the algorithmic Zeitgeist. What works on the platform, is it galleries, engagement driven posts, video content, etc. (spoiler: most likely it is short form, vertical videos). 

Now you know who, where and what your goals are. Now let‚Äôs figure out how. 

Content strategy: 
Any brand needs to stick out. You are one swipe away from insignificance. 
A tip of mine is always the rule of 5S: 
- simple (one KPI per post as a rule of thumb, easy to understand messages, don‚Äôt be over complicated) 
- stringent (don‚Äôt flip flop ideas but be consistent with your formats for a while to get a qualitative and quantitative analysis)
- sustainable (don‚Äôt think of Formats that hinder you in production or cost too much time for little results) 
- strategic (post when you have something to say and it ticks all your strategy boxes) 
- shareable (content has to 1: reflect users point of view 2: help users express themself 3: users identify someone they know)",-1,-1

18237,"Try the Snoopreport activity tracker. It works exclusively for Instagram, but that's enough for me. 

With it, you can add any users with a public profile to the tracking and receive weekly reports on their likes, interests, hashtags, follows. The maximum plan allows you to track 100 users at the same time, which will allow you to get a serious slice of data. Moreover, you can access data for the past period up to 36 weeks.

Personally, I use this tool to attract an audience of competitors; drawing up an engaging content strategy; selecting niche hashtags; searching for consumer insights, and so on, depending on the tasks. It greatly helps to reduce the time for manual monitoring and analysis.",-1,-1

I‚Äôd write for lawn care businesses, limo rental companies, childcare facilities, car detailing companies, luxury flower subscriptions, or literally just whatever else was put on my plate that day. It was true then and now that the client always gets to see any and all content before it‚Äôs scheduled. The expert gets final approval without having to do the work themselves. Now, I operate as a freelancer, and the clients I have are people and businesses who personally trust me to help them achieve their social media goals. Nobody expects me to be an expert in their field, but they trust me to provide informative, fun, and relevant content while also, and way more importantly, handling everything else that comes with social media management. None of my clients care if I write the words that make up a post or if AI does, as long as what‚Äôs being posted fits their brand messaging and aligns with the goals of their company.

First, you need to find influencers in the niche you are interested in, so you can access similar profiles, since they will probably subscribe to them or even have publications with tags.

 Next, you need to study the audience of the profiles you are interested in and also search through their signatures. That is, in this way you will be able to use the snowball method to find various accounts in the niche you are interested in.

For Shorts, I would focus on creating a video that is short and to the point, with a clear message and a strong call to action.

Personally, I don‚Äôt focus just on the approach but I also focus on how to promote each video on each platform. When it comes to promoting the videos, I would focus on using the appropriate hashtags and keywords for each platform. For Tiktok, I would use popular hashtags and trends to reach a wider audience. 

For Reels, I would use creative hashtags and keywords to attract the right viewers. Lately I hire a growth service on instagram called Ascend viral to help me to get the right audience organically and I found it amazing. Anyways, for Shorts I would use keywords that are related to the content of the video. Additionally, I would also use influencers and other social media platforms to promote the videos.",-1,-1

I just ask because I feel like recording the mistakes per say might be difficult without talking in the moment kinda thing whereas talking throughout the exercise would be easier to explain in detail and actually show those mistakes.

Make your account attractive. Use themes, or set a particular tone for your feed. Use a username and name that is easily searchable.Write a good and informative bio. 

Engage with more people and follow small accounts in your niche. It is very important to find people in your niche so they will watch your videos and you will gain more followers. If you can't find them, you can find a marketing agency that provides this kind of services like ascend viral. I have seen people recommending them but check them to know more about it.

18469,"There‚Äôs an entire underground marketplace devoted to buying, selling or swapping unique and generic usernames. The most common way of obtaining them is by utilizing a media partner but most Meta reps will not entertain claims for anything generic that you can‚Äôt issue a trademark for. Our rep is only capable of processing claims for usernames that are at least six characters long, non-generic and have been inactive for at least a year or more.

The ones that are capable of claiming generics are usually corrupt and charge a ridiculous price tag in order to process the claim. Those with access to such reps end up reselling the handles to the highest bidder. Usually accounts like that must still be inactive though. If they‚Äôre not inactive, then it‚Äôs practically impossible to claim it regardless of which route you take.

Last I heard, @drip on Instagram got sold for a whopping $75k. Some generic handles are actively listed for sale across various Tele channels like @malicious ($15k), @administrator ($9k), @scanner ($2.2k) and hundreds of others. Even handles that are just random, short combinations of letters such as @teu, @igs, @jre are being sold for close to $6k in value so it‚Äôs definitely a lucrative field to be in despite being very obscure.

18476,"The username isn‚Äôt available error just means that the account that last had it is currently banned or de-activated. After about a year or so, the existence of the account ID is wiped entirely from their servers (i.e. perma-ban) and the username will become available again. However, if it‚Äôs a desirable handle, you have to be prepared for that to happen as they‚Äôll get swept quickly as soon as they‚Äôre available again.

In fact, there are some very powerful private bots out there who scour every generic username practically every couple seconds to detect availability. That is why swapping services exist. To ensure that if you‚Äôre undergoing a username change and switching to a highly valuable handle, some automated tool does not steal it right out from under you as soon as the holder releases it from their account.

18486,"You‚Äôve been slapped with the ‚Äúviral curse‚Äù friend. You go viral, this brings in a shit ton of low quality followers. By low quality I mean people who will tap follow on everything they like meaning they follow so many accounts they don‚Äôt/can‚Äôt see them all and thusly don‚Äôt interact with them. 
The algorithm then farms out your new post to a small selection of these new low quality followers, they don‚Äôt interact with it because they just don‚Äôt see it, the algorithm then decides your post isn‚Äôt interesting and ceases pushing it to the wider audience. 

Just keep pushing on. I find Tiktok is the most dramatic and sporadic when it comes to post result consistency. Instagram tends to be more reliable with numbers but going super viral on there is far rarer.",-1,-1

18490,"This is really interesting. There are a few things you could do next. If the like and comment ratio was good on the viral post, you can find a comment that has lots of likes (over 300 if possible) and make a video response. This should guarantee you over 2000 views as those who liked the video and the comment will most likely enjoy the response.  

If your video got 200K views but less than 7K engagements, I wouldn't consider this a viral post. it means your content got served to a lot of people and they may have spent time with it but didn't find their time well spent. IE. like, comment or share. 

Tiktok algorithm will serve your content to 10 people, then 100, then 1000, then 10 000, etc. People engaging with your content in the early stages help it be pushed further.  It may be that your new content isn't ""hitting"" the same viral audience. this is where trending sounds, well-known formats, and internet language come in.",-1,-1

I think this might be the case where the viral video worked against your account. That video brought in a ton of views/engagement/retention to the point that it screwed with your account. If the following videos didn‚Äôt perform as well as that viral video did within those certain ‚Äúmilestones‚Äù, TikTok will probably categorize it under something like ‚Äúthis video won‚Äôt catch these viewers attention‚Äù.

Work with foodie influencers. Repost their content on your page. 

Some video ideas I can think of: 
-What's new on the menu
-Our top 5 most popular dishes 
-Everything I ate for dinner at X 
-Watch me chow down x 
-My boo and I visited this new restaurant
-What our Chefs eat in the restaurant
-Share a simple recipe",-1,-1
18505,"Facebook, just put your menu and hours up and that alone will go a long way. Photos of your food. Great looking photos of your food will go further. You could probably hire someone to do it. I‚Äôm sure ads when you‚Äôre in a slump could go a long way too. Facebook is a bit of a pay to play game now a days.

Google for sure, make sure you‚Äôre getting high results in search results. ad sense may be a good route too if you want to start getting the established presence. 

Instagram could be a good route too. Especially if you get good photos done. Brag about success, highlight some reviews from various places etc. stories are easy to disturb to different platforms like TikTok and Faceboook, but make sure the content is interesting or you‚Äôre just wasting time. 

Twitter for daily specials and everything above

Reddit could work based of your location. 

Keep track of Yelp, it‚Äôs a good resource for direct review, but make sure to answer positively or not at all. Keep track of any repeating negative reviews.

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more, but I‚Äôm not sure what your budget is, where you are located, what your competition is, what kind of food you serve, and your overall goal. It may just be worth it to hire a social media person if you can afford to contract them out. Keep in mind none of this will help if you‚Äôre food isn‚Äôt up to snuff.",-1,-1
18506,Try Nextdoor,-1,-1
18507,"Only you can answer which social media is best suited for your restaurant by studying the niche, direct and indirect competitors, drawing up a portrait of your target audience and studying their behavior patterns. Do not skip this step, as it is really fundamental and will allow you to create a content strategy and attract customers in the future. 

As for content and promotion, I advise you to focus on one key factor. Since you are promoting an offline business, you need to focus on local promotion. To do this, again, it is necessary to study the audience of similar places very well, as well as correctly select hashtags to promote through the local audience. If we are talking about Instagram, then I can advise the online activity tracker Snoopreport. With it, you can add any users with a public profile to the tracking and receive weekly reports on their hashtags, follows, likes and interests. I can't recommend similar experiments for other social networks, since I work exclusively on Instagram, but in general you can focus on this data. They will allow you to create your own engaging content strategy, pick up niche hashtags, attract new customers, and in general get valuable insights about the behavior of your target audience. 

Good luck!",-1,-1
18508,"Congrats on opening your dream restaurant! That's amazing. I want to come eat there just by the way you called it your dream.

Doing social media for a business is a struggle. It takes a lot of energy to get the desired effect. I suggest considering hiring professionals for a ferry months to get it started and then you can continue that momentum they get going for you. Copy their tactics that work.

If you don't want to look at popular similar businesses and copy their tactics.

Stay consistent. Have a voice.

You sound passionate. If you're in front of the camera and people connect with you then you'll do better than just food photos. If you can make it funny the better.

18517,"Hi! Verification standards and processes vary by network - Meta has continued to consistently verify our journalists, Twitter‚Äôs a mess right now, TikTok will verify our brands but not our journalists. That said, prior to Elon‚Äôs Twitter takeover and TikTok‚Äôs diplomatic issues, most social networks would verify accounts that clearly represented people who were‚Ä¶

‚Ä¢ Public figures

‚Ä¢ Noteworthy

‚Ä¢ Established platform users

To the last point, most networks won‚Äôt verify new accounts. Meta‚Äôs Instagram used to be most challenging: we coached our journalists to post three work-related photos or videos to their feed - not Story - every week for three months before they submit. 

To the former two points, know that your verification request may be reviewed by a system or person who is not from your country or familiar with its journalism customs or culture. They also may not see a record of your content that expires, like Stories. So when someone looks at your account, they should be able to tell immediately that you are a public, noteworthy person and that verifying you would benefit their users. Keep your bios simple - just say you‚Äôre a journalist and only link to reputable, known news orgs. I work in TV, and we coach our journalists not to use terms like anchor or host in bios, as they are not universal. And post public content related to your reporting that shows you‚Äôre a figure in the public interest. If verification is your goal, worry less about engagement and more about proving the network should verify you. 

Last tip: chat with the sites you work for and see if they have contacts and resources to assist.

so now home feed reflects more 50:50 as they still are promoting videos but still supporting photos

2. Make reels that not only adds value to your target audience but also entertains them

3. Try collaborating with accounts in your niche & reach out to influencers who has the audience you want.

4. Post stories that makes your followers interact.",-1,-1
18752,"Creating a social media strategy when a platform like Instagram is on the decline can be challenging, but there are a few key steps that you can take to ensure that your brand continues to engage and connect with your audience.

First, it's important to understand which platforms are still growing and where your target audience is spending most of their time. You can use tools like Google Trends and Alexa to research which platforms are gaining popularity, and then create a content strategy that is tailored to these platforms.

Second, you need to create a content that is interesting, informative and engaging. This will help you to build a following and keep your audience engaged. Use a variety of content types such as videos, images, and text to make your content more visually appealing and shareable.

Third, you should focus on building relationships with your audience. This can be done by responding to comments, messages, and DMs promptly, and by creating a sense of community around your brand.

Finally, it's important to be consistent with your posting schedule, as well as with your branding and messaging. By following these steps, you'll be able to create a social media strategy that will allow you to continue to engage and connect with your audience, even if Instagram is on the decline.",-1,-1
18753,"The main problem of Instagram at the moment is that they change their algorithms too often because of this, users and content makers do not have time to adapt.

In fact, I have found a solution for myself - it is to focus on content and constantly update the strategy in accordance with the interests of my audience. For example, global hashtags used to work well, but now local niche ones bring much better reach.

The main mistake of many content creators is the lack of an analytical base in the form of direct and indirect competitors and, most importantly, the target audience. For some reason, many consciously or accidentally skip this step. Although now there are even a large number of auxiliary tools that make this process easier.

If we talk about Instagram, then I can advise the online activity tracker Snoopreport. With it, you can monitor likes, hashtags, follows and interests of any users with a public profile. Most often, I track my current followers or competitors' followers, but sometimes also some specific target audience, depending on the tasks. Such data allows you to get valuable insights and organically advance in Instagram.

Yes, now the numbers may not be as big as they were a year or two ago before the global updates. But nevertheless, such an organic method is still the most effective and fruitful in the long term.",-1,-1
18754,"
Here are a few suggestions for creating a social media strategy for Instagram:

1.Understand your audience: Who are your target customers, and where do they spend their time on Instagram? 

Understand their interests, pain points, and what type of content they're most likely to engage with.


2.Set clear goals: What do you want to achieve with your Instagram strategy? Increased brand awareness, more website traffic, or sales? 

Having clear goals in mind will help you stay focused and measure the success of your strategy.


3.Create a content calendar: Plan out your content in advance to ensure a consistent and cohesive brand message. 

This will help you to stay organized, save time, and avoid last-minute scrambling for content.


4.Use Instagram's features: Instagram is constantly updating its features and tools to help businesses engage with their audience. 

Features like Instagram Stories, IGTV, and Reels can be great ways to drive engagement and reach new audiences.


5.Measure and Optimize: Track your performance and engagement metrics, and use the data to optimize your strategy. 

Use insights and analytics to understand what's working and what's not, and adjust your strategy accordingly.


remember that social media strategy is not a one-time fix, it's an ongoing process that should be reviewed and updated regularly. It's also important to diversify your social media strategy and not to rely solely on one platform. As a social media specialist, it will be important to have a deep understanding of the different platforms, their strengths and weaknesses, and the target audience that each platform serves.",-1,-1

1) comment/like posts on influencers/top accounts in your niche 10 mins before posting. 
2) post every day for 60 days switching between static posts, carousel posts and reels. After 60 days, find what gets you the most engagement and build content pillars off of that. 
3) create engaging story posts. Think this or that niche-specific stories, Q+As, polls
4) spend about 10 mins a day watching reels to find trending sounds and save them. That way when you‚Äôre ready to post a reel you have a plethora to choose from.

18774,"Been seeing a lot of tik tok ban discussions due to security concerns but does anyone else find it funny how America wants to monopolise on the user information market? So they have a grudge against Chinese applications. The reason countries like India banned tik tok is because that company is making less of an effort to create political echo chambers for governments to use as propaganda, usually you are exposed to a wide variety of viewpoints on tik tok. Unlike meta products where the content you see on those sites varies country to country. I went to Morocco and used tik tok and was exposed to Arabic LGBTQ discussions which is a massive no no in that country. Where as meta seemed to have censored that content for me whilst I was on holiday and I was shown the more conservative content instead.

The information tik tok collects is literally the same as what meta companies do. Infact the lawsuit against Facebook was one of the main reasons they changed their company name to meta, so that Instagram and WhatsApp is not associated with Facebook on the surface level for the less informed.

At the end of the day. All social media sites will eventually die that's why it's best to not put all your eggs in one basket and not give up on Instagram. As for strategy I'm seeing reels being used more commonly than people viewing actual posts so focus on that as a strategy and use those reels to create posts. With the marriage between Instagram and Facebook pages, it's worth making sure you are utilising Facebook links as well, as meta doesn't want Facebook to die off so they seem to favour linked posts.",-1,-1

Yes, big tech has faces many threats to being shut down. But has it occurred to you that big tech in this country might have a very solid financial interest in getting TT banned? They are all trying to mimic TT but their strategy has shifted to include getting the platform removed because if it does their pieces of the pie get soooo much bigger. And that is something Meta, Twitter, Pinterest and YouTube can all agree on.

Social media platforms today are a mess, you need years of experience and you will sooner or later struggle with unexpected restrictions which will make you hate the platforms.

Also, its not fair to sell your services to customers if you do not know what you are doing. 
-Someone working in a SMM agency for several years now",-1,-1
18913,"I have been doing social media professionally since ~2007 or so. I've worked in house, at an agency, and now own a consulting agency. I also teach college level SMM, and grew up with two small business owning parents. There's three sides to your question: 

1- For SM skills: Make sure you have a good understanding of professional skills in strategy, reporting, paid SM, organic SM, crisis comms, PR, influencer relationships, and measuring both ROI and ROAS. You don't have to be an expert in everything, but you need to know enough to know when you're being BSed or when a client has unreasonable expectations. And you need to be able to clearly set reasonable expectations you know how to actually achieve.  

2- For owning a business: you need to spend some time setting yourself up for business success. (What follows assumes you're US based) Even if you plan on being a one person show / freelancer, you need to have a setup and plan for: 

Business structure (Sole prop? LLC? S-Corp? C-corp?) 

Accounting and taxes

Business plan for yourself, including a target audience, marketing plan, etc. 

Licenses-- EIN, state licenses, local licenses, any others required. 

Business insurance so you're protected if you make a mistake that costs your clients a lot of money. 

This isn't just a clever name and logo. This is the foundation work that will make or break most businesses, no matter the type. 

Again, you don't have to be an expert. But you should have thought about it, consulted with an accountant and / or tax professional, etc. Your local SCORE can likely help. 

3- For owning an *agency* specifically - know how you plan to hire, train, retain, compensate, and fire employees or contractors. Take a management class or two. And think about how you'll do your work. Do you want everyone to communicate via email? Slack? Discord?
Do you want W2 employees 1099 contractors? How about quoting -- will you do standard packages or customized quotes? Can your employees quote for you? How does that impact cash flow? Are you comfortable doing net 60? Or net 30? All of this impacts the day to day stuff behind doing the work. 

And finally -- some advice-- if you'll be *only* using those platforms you list, make that super clear to your clients. Not all clients are best served by those platforms, and as audiences shift, so do platforms. Partner with people who know other platforms or start learning ASAP and don't stop.  Professional SMM is *very* different from personal SMM. 

If you have never worked with a client, start by volunteering with a local nonprofit and learn some ropes first and make your worst mistakes before someone is paying you for them -- otherwise cleaning up those messes could cost you more than you make.",-1,-1

18916,"If what you listed is your experience in smm, you aren‚Äôt ready for an internship at my agency‚Ä¶ 

The clients with viable budgets need you to know Wordpress, ad buys, YouTube/Vimeo, LinkedIn, and on FB, you need to get really granular and go beyond posting to a company page because the organic reach there is crap. 

Twitter is questionable but I still have a fair number of clients who want to be there (but we aren‚Äôt advertising right now). You will also need to know about alternative platforms like Pinterest, Reddit, Quora, and the upcoming platforms the bigger guys may copy features from. 

You will want to be an expert in content management systems and publishing software. I pay good money for software that allows me to easily crosspost content optimized for each platform. Nothing looks more unprofessional than seeing some clown show agency crosspost from Instagram to Facebook in a format that is obviously for Instagram (and the dot dot dot string of hashtags has been unprofessional for a while)‚Ä¶ 

You need to know how to manage entity governance and admin settings on all of the platforms and that also can be a headache if you‚Äôre a new agency. 

You will also want professional liability insurance that covers marketing claims. You will need contracts with clients. 

I don‚Äôt touch graphic design beyond Canva, but I have partners who can handle graphic design, video production (it‚Äôs more than using your phone for TikTok), and PR. If you don‚Äôt have expertise in everything and want to go ahead, you will likely need to hire a lot of help.

As for Instagram, I couldn't even reach 1k followers, even after posting daily for about 3 months and posting the same videos that I post on Tiktok. So I went for a growth service to grow my account. I found an agency named ascend viral, and since they grow accounts organically with no bots, I went for them and they handled my account for few months until I reached a decent number of followers.

‚Ä¢consistency

Also post engaging stories such as polls, asking people questions, telling them to repost something...

I only talked about instagram, but right now I think it's the best way to promote something (and also tiktok)... 

If you want easy traffic (extremely low conversion rate) post on tiktok, create 10 different videos involving your t shirts and constantly repost them... Trust me, a friend of mine did this with some kindles, and it was insane...

Using tiktok is a cheat code...

Then if tou want to scale it up even more, create an email list and from then it's up to you if you want to nurture it by hiring a copywriter, that wat you make sure that someone will be there to buy anytime you launch something new...

But you also will not be able to offer the same prices that the Biebers of the world can.

I recommend looking around for some similar social media influencers that are not in the music world and ask them what their pricing structure is. You definitely should never charge less than $100. Hell, I‚Äôd probably start at $200 or $500 and throw in some extra elements like analytics reporting, a bigger package with multiple posts, or even a package that offers ‚Äúthe works‚Äù that would include you creating a short video promoting their music. 

You have a ton of opportunity here, it all depends on how much you want to dig in invest (time-wise) in becoming an influencer and content creator.

My Instagram page was getting down because of them until I found this agency called Ascend viral. They helped to to get real followers organically.

19016,"This sounds concrete, don't over think it just do it.",-1,-1
19017,"Hey, hope you are doing well!

A. Your approach is right also but let me suggest something.

B. First, make a google sheet of Content Calendar 

1- Decide the dates. like on which dates you are going to post your content.

2- Decide which content you are uploading if it's an Image/Video.

3- Decide the caption for your content.

4- Post 2-3 pieces of content a week.

5- Decide the budget. (if you're running campaign ads)

6- Make a deadline for it like if you have done that content or not. 

Try to post some creative content, deals, or offers that attract your customer through your store.

C. I make the same Content Calendar for my clients as well.",-1,-1
19018,"You should definitely download an app like Preview! It connects to your Instagram and will load all of your current content from your feed. Then you can plan your new content in advance and see how it will visually look on your Instagram feed. You can also add your captions and hashtags as well! I typically write my captions a day in advance depending on my post. I‚Äôm a SMM for a brand and here is my strategy.

-Post 6 times a week on IG
2-3 Reels and 3-4 Static Post depending on the week 

-Post on all relevant food holidays to the brand 

-Have monthly photo shoots where I can then batch create all of my content/reels for the month. I typically can get enough content for a month or two from one shoot. 

-Hashtag Research: I use around 20 of the same researched hashtags on every post and then add around 5 new hashtags that are relevant to the post that day. 

-Repost all Reels/TikTok‚Äôs to Pinterest as Idea Pins

-TikTok is great to help you find your niche and see what current sounds and videos are trending. 

-ENGAGE with other accounts that are in your niche! Always respond to comments and DMS. 

-I always repost UGC stories that we are tagged in and interact with customers via DM.",-1,-1
19019,Excellent advice here. For content ideas‚Ä¶you could Google to look up hashtag holidays for 2023 and start making posts ahead. You‚Äôll end up participating in your favorite themes with several on-brand posts this way. I used this strategy for IG but it could work well on other platforms.,-1,-1
19020,"Looks solid to me. Let us know how it goes, OP.",-1,-1
19021,"great advice. 

i've got a few more questions if you don't mind answering.

how long have you been implementing that strategy and what has been the growth using that strategy?

is the brand a single restaurant, chain, or food product?

what's your method for researching hashtags? 

what's the idea/reasoning to the pinterest idea pins?",-1,-1
19022,"I‚Äôve been doing this strategy for about a year now and our Instagram account has gained around 4,000 followers and we have done multiple collabs with other big name food/beverage brands as well. I also started our TikTok account a year ago and we‚Äôve gained 2,000 followers from scratch and I‚Äôve have a video go viral with over 1.2 million views!

-The brand I work for has 4 local shop locations and we are also available Nationwide in Sprouts Farmers Market as well as a few local Whole Foods locations and other grocery stores. 

-I simply looked at other accounts in our niche and saw what hashtags they were doing and what worked best for them. Typically it‚Äôs best to use hashtags in the 1K-500k range so your content is more likely to get noticed when you search that hashtag. Any hashtags over a 1M are way too saturated. 

-Pinterest has been an awesome extra form of free marketing! It‚Äôs probably one of the best upcoming Social Media Apps. I simply just repost all of my video content from our Reels/TikToks and the engagement is great! Our account gets around 80K monthly views and we get great engagement as well as traffic to our website.",-1,-1

Start observing more content, and read the comments along with that. Observe what people are talking about, and what you can give in return. Plus, make sure you do good work on your copywriting. Try Copy.ai for a while to learn some copywriting styles. Lead generation is another thing.

19032,"Hi u/selma2095 I specialize in #PPCAds, but I think I can answer at least 1 of your questions.

1. A better formula might be to use ((Likes + Comments) / Total Impressions or Reach) x 100

This would consider the fact that not every single one of your followers may have seen your post. Shares are also included with your engagement rate.

2. Were all of your posts scheduled from Hootsuite? Every publishing platform doesn‚Äôt always track posts unless they‚Äôre made from the platform.

3. This is interesting. Perhaps, double check your date range or give Hootsuite 1-2 days to register recent posts if it is not up to date.
